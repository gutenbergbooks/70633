</div>

<p class="no-indent">These Notes are composed very largely of extracts,
relating to the work of Territorial Infantry Divisions,
taken from the published despatches. These divisions
saw a great deal of heavy fighting throughout the
years 1916 and 1917, but the numbers, or Territorial
designations, of formations operating on the Western
Front were not given in despatches, as published
in the <cite>Gazette</cite>, until the Commander-in-Chief reported
on 20th February, 1918, as to the battle of
Cambrai, November 1917. However, in the edition
of <cite>Sir Douglas Haig’s Despatches</cite>, published by
Messrs. Dent, the divisions, which are referred to
as being engaged in the more important battles,
are identified by number; and, in compiling these
Notes, advantage (with permission) has been taken
of this additional information.</p>

<p>The facts recited by the Field-Marshals and
Generals, who commanded the British Armies in
the field, and the judgments expressed by them
in their despatches seem to be the best, if not the
only reliable, material from which to form an opinion
on the value of the services of the Territorial Force
in the great struggle. It will generally be admitted
that the opinion of units on their own doings would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
not be quite impartial and could not be used to form
a basis for assessing the value of the Force as a whole.</p>

<p>Under the Territorial Act of 1907 fourteen
infantry divisions were formed. Some of these
sailed for the East in September and October, 1914,
and all the fourteen had embarked for abroad before
July 1915. If it had not been necessary to keep in
view the question of armament and the possibility
of invasion, several divisions might have been in
France before the close of the first battle of Ypres.
If that had been found practicable Lord French
might have had fewer anxieties in November 1914.
His Lordship, in his despatches and elsewhere, has
borne testimony to the valuable services of the
Territorial battalions which were under his command
in 1914.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if Britain ever quite realised what
it owed to the Territorials who went abroad before
the New Armies were ready. Apart from the four
divisions which went to the East in the autumn of
1914, thus allowing the Indian Corps to be brought
to France, the Territorial strength, in France alone,
in April 1915, before the second great struggle
at Ypres broke out, probably exceeded that of the
British Army at Mons, and it is by no means certain
that the ten Regular divisions plus two Indian
divisions and one Canadian could have held the
great “gas attack.”</p>

<p>In September 1914 the Army Council decided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
raise second line units to take the place of those
which had gone or were to go abroad. Before the
end of that year most counties had raised their
second lines, and in many, third line, or depot
battalions to supply drafts had been recruited.
The original function of the second line divisions
was to form an army for use in the event of invasion
being attempted, but, eventually, eight of these
divisions went to active service abroad, chiefly in
1916; and one division of infantry, the 74th, was
formed in the East, mainly from dismounted Yeomanry,
and acquitted itself with credit in Palestine
and afterwards in France. From those second line
divisions which were not sent abroad some individual
battalions were taken and all “A” category men
remaining went as drafts.</p>

<p>Several of the second line divisions did extremely
well, perhaps because they had the advantage of a
long mobilised training at home before embarking,
and the brotherhood or family spirit among all ranks
was thoroughly developed. The original Territorial
Force was doubtless deficient in many respects,
but it started on mobilisation with the enormous
advantage that the officers, N.C.O.s and men of
a battalion were known to one another and the
family spirit grew quickly.</p>

<p>During the first four months of the War, as
already stated, many Territorial battalions went to
the Front and were attached to Regular divisions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
some of these rejoined the Territorial divisions
from their own districts when the latter arrived in
the battle area; others were never in Territorial
formations, serving throughout the War with the
Regular or New Armies. No account of the doings
of these latter battalions is given in these Notes,
although some of the very best units in the Force
were among those which never served in it at the
Front. The value of their services, which was enhanced
because they were able to go abroad at a
most critical period, should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>The <cite>Croix de Guerre</cite> (<cite>Palme en Bronze</cite>), a coveted
but seldom bestowed honour, was awarded by the
President of the French Republic to one such
battalion, the 4th, The King’s Shropshire Light
Infantry, T.F., in the following circumstances, as
set out in the orders of the General commanding
one of the French Armies:</p>

<p>“On June 6th, 1918, when the right flank of an
English brigade, which had been heavily engaged,
was threatened by the enemy’s advance, the
battalion in reserve, the 1/4th Battalion of the
King’s Shropshire Light Infantry, was ordered to
deliver a counter-attack against an important
position, from which the garrison had been driven.
With magnificent dash and after heavy fighting
the position was recovered, and with it the key to
the whole line of defence, which made it possible
to re-establish the line and maintain it intact.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span></p>

<p>At that time the battalion was serving with the
19th (New Army) Division, south-west of Reims,
when the enemy was making one of his greatest
efforts.</p>

<p>There were occasions when Territorial battalions
earned the praise of British Divisional, Corps and
Army Commanders, while they were serving in
Regular or New Army formations; but we have
not yet adopted the system of giving honours to
units, although there is much to be said for it.</p>

<p>The Mounted Brigades, Artillery, Medical and
Technical branches of the Force do not come within
the scope of these Notes, but no assessment of its
value would be just which neglected to take their
services into account.</p>

<p>It is generally recognised that the defeat of
Turkey helped to bring the end of the War nearer;
it is not generally known, or realised, that the Force
under Sir Edmund Allenby, which between 31st
October and 9th December, 1917, smashed the Turks
and cleared southern Palestine from Gaza and
Beersheba to Joppa and Jerusalem, was practically
a Territorial Army; nearly five-sixths of the Infantry
belonged to that Force, while the mounted
men were chiefly Yeomanry and Colonials.</p>

<p>At a conference as to the reorganisation of the
Force held on 1st April, 1919, when the Secretary
of State for War met representatives of the County
Associations, Mr. Churchill said: “I could not meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
this body representing the Territorial Associations
of the United Kingdom without expressing on behalf
of the War Office and on behalf of King and country
our profound gratitude to the Territorial Force for
the services which they have rendered in the Great
War. There have been killed in the Territorial
Force more than 6,500 officers, and more than
105,000 men; and in the killed, wounded, and missing,
26,900 officers and 565,000 men are included.
This Force, which in so many quarters was hardly
regarded seriously as a military factor before the
Great War, has sent 1,045,000 men to fight against
the best troops of Germany and of Turkey, and
having sustained these terrible losses, has acquitted
itself on all occasions in a manner which has won
the whole-hearted acceptance of their Regular
comrades and of the finest soldiers who have come
to our assistance from the Dominions overseas.
Twenty-nine officers and forty-two men of other
ranks in the Territorial Force have gained the
supreme honour of the Victoria Cross.”</p>

<p>As some of the principal newspapers did not quote
this part of Mr. Churchill’s remarks it is excusable
to repeat it here.</p>

<p>Most grateful acknowledgment is made of the permission
granted by the Controller of His Majesty’s
Stationery Office to quote the extracts given from
the published despatches as appearing in the <cite>Gazette</cite>,
also, of that of Messrs. J. M. Dent and Sons, Limited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
to refer to their edition of <cite>Sir Douglas Haig’s
Despatches</cite>, December 1915-April 1919, edited by
Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Boraston, O.B.E., Private
Secretary to Earl Haig. Permission to refer to Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle’s <cite>British Campaign in France
and Flanders</cite> has also very kindly been given.
Although that work is not recognised as an official
history, Sir Arthur had a very large mass of official
material placed at his disposal, and much of the
information he gives, particularly in regard to the
work of divisions and the losses sustained by them
in the big battles, is of great value. Thanks for
similar permissions are also tendered to the author
of <cite>The Fifth Army in March 1918</cite>, Mr. W. Shaw
Sparrow, and his publishers Messrs. John Lane,
The Bodley Head, Limited, and to the author of
<cite>The Story of the Fourth Army</cite>, Major-General Sir
Archibald Montgomery, K.C.M.G., C.B., and his
publishers Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton, Limited.
In a letter signifying his approval, Major-General
Montgomery remarks: “I know what excellent
work the Territorial Divisions did and I hope that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>they will always get full credit for it.”</p>

TERRITORIAL DIVISIONS</p>

First Line</h2>

<p class="no-indent">The Division sailed for Egypt on September 10th,
1914, at a time when sanguine people thought that
the only rôle of the Territorial Force would be to
provide garrisons for our outlying Dependencies.
It was the first Territorial division to leave Britain.</p>

<p>While in Egypt the Division supplied part of the
Canal Defence Force, the Artillery and Engineers
of the Division being engaged in February 1915,
when the Turkish attack on the Canal was driven
off. See despatches from Sir A. Wilson, C.B., dated
11th February, 1915, and 1st August, 1915. In the
former, paragraph 37, the 19th Lancashire Battery
R.F.A., T.F., was said to have rendered excellent
service.</p>

<p>During the six months following their arrival in
Egypt, the Division did much hard marching and
training of all kinds.</p>

<p>At the beginning of May 1915 the Division
embarked for the Dardanelles, and the Lancashire
Fusilier Brigade, the 125th, disembarked on 5th
May (see Sir Ian Hamilton’s despatch of 20th May)
in time to take part in the sanguinary fighting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
6th-10th May, now called the Second Battle of
Krithia.</p>

<p>In his despatch of 26th August, 1915, Sir Ian
Hamilton describes the struggle. Our tired troops
had to attack formidable opposing lines, the enemy
being well entrenched. The Brigade was attached
temporarily to the 29th Division. A certain amount
of progress was made on the 6th May. On the 7th
at 3 p.m. the two brigades on the left, Lancashire
Fusilier Brigade and 88th Brigade, were held up,
but a general attack of the whole line ordered for
4.45 p.m. gained ground. Heavy counter-attacks
were delivered till dawn on the 10th, these were
repulsed. On the 11th the 42nd, which had completed
its disembarkation on the 9th, relieved the
29th Division, now worn out after eighteen days’
hard fighting. Shortly after this the Force settled
down to what was practically siege warfare.</p>

<p>During the latter half of May the 42nd Division
worked night and day on a series of new fire and
communication trenches in “no man’s land,” which
brought their front line within assaulting distance.
On 25th May the Royal Naval and 42nd Divisions
crept 100 yards nearer to the Turks, and on the
night of May 28th/29th the whole British Line made
a further small advance.</p>

<p>Each night till 3rd/4th June attacks by the enemy
were made on the new line, but these were repulsed.</p>

<p>A general assault was ordered for the 4th June.
This is now the Third Battle of Krithia. Sir Ian
said: “The Manchester Brigade of the 42nd Division
advanced magnificently. In five minutes the
first line of Turkish trenches was captured and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
12.30 p.m. the Brigade had carried with a rush the
line forming their second objective, having made an
advance of 600 yards in all. The working parties
got to work without incident and the position here
could not possibly have been better.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the advance was not successful
on the front of the 29th Division, on the left of the
42nd, while later there was a withdrawal of troops
on the right. “The enfilade fire of the Turks began
to fall upon the Manchester Brigade of the 42nd
Division which was firmly consolidating the furthest
distant line of trenches it had so brilliantly won.
After 1.30 p.m. it became increasingly difficult for
this gallant Brigade to hold its ground, heavy casualties
occurred, the Brigadier and many other officers
were wounded or killed, yet it continued to hold out
with the greatest tenacity and grit. Every effort
was made to sustain the Brigade in its position, its
right flank was thrown back to make face against
the enfilade fire.... It became clear that unless
the right of our line could advance again it would
be impossible for the Manchesters to maintain the
very pronounced salient in which they now found
themselves.” Eventually “By 6.30 p.m. therefore the
42nd Division had to be extricated with loss from
the second line Turkish trenches and had to content
themselves with consolidating on the first line which
they had captured within five minutes of commencing
the attack. Such was the spirit displayed
by this Brigade that there was great difficulty in
persuading the men to fall back. Had their flanks
been covered nothing would have made them loosen
their grip.... About 400 prisoners were taken in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the attack. The majority of these captures were
made by the 42nd Division under Major-General
W. Douglas.”</p>

<p>The Division was not heavily engaged in the
battles of 28th June and 12th-13th July.</p>

<p>The despatch of 11th December, 1915, contains
an account of the Suvla Bay fighting and of certain
operations undertaken on 6th-8th August at Helles
to contain the enemy there. The 29th Division was
to attack about 1200 yards of front and the 42nd
was asked to capture two trenches. The Turks were
found “full of fight.” The 29th did not progress.
“Two resolute separate attacks were made by the
42nd Division but both of these recoiled in face of
the unexpected volume of fire developed by the
Turks.” The reason was that our attack and one
by the Turks had almost coincided and the enemy
trenches were full of men.</p>

<p>On August 7th the attack was renewed and there
was again very heavy fighting. “In the centre a
stiff battle raged all day up and down a vineyard....
A large portion of the vineyard had been
captured in the first dash and the East Lancashire
men in this part of the field stood their ground
against a succession of vigorous counter-attacks.
The enemy suffered very severely in these counter-attacks
which were launched in strength and at
short intervals.... Owing to the fine endurance
of the 6th and 7th Battalions of the Lancashire
Fusiliers it was found possible to hold the vineyard
through the night, and a massive column of the
enemy which strove to overwhelm their thinned
ranks was shattered to pieces in the attempt....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
For two more days the troops (42nd Division) were
called upon to show their qualities of vigilance
and power of determined resistance, for the enemy
had by no means yet lost hope of wresting from us
the ground we had won in the vineyard. This unceasing
struggle was a supreme test for battalions
already exhausted by 48 hours’ desperate fighting,
and weakened by the loss of so many good leaders
and men, but the peculiar grit of the Lancastrians
was equal to the strain, and they did not fail. Two
specially furious counter-attacks were delivered by
the Turks on the 8th August, one at 4.40 a.m., and
another at 8.30 p.m., where again our bayonets
were too much for them. Throughout the night they
made continuous bomb attacks, but the 6th Lancashire
Fusiliers and the 4th East Lancashire Regiment
stuck gamely to their task at the eastern corner of
the vineyard. There was desperate fighting also at
the northern corner, where the personal bravery
of Lieutenant W. T. Forshaw, 1/9th Manchester
Regiment, who stuck to his post after his detachment
had been relieved, an act for which he has since
been awarded the V.C., was largely instrumental
in the repulse of three very determined onslaughts.”</p>

<p>By the morning of August 9th “things were
quieter and the sorely tried troops were relieved.”
The fighting, 6th to 13th August, is now officially
the “Actions of Krithia Vineyard.”</p>

<p>The Division, which was now at little more than
one-third of its establishment, received a reinforcement
of dismounted yeomen in September. It was
incidentally mentioned in Sir C. C. Monro’s despatch
of 6th March, 1916, regarding the evacuation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Helles, as being, in December 1915, badly in need of
rest. The losses of the Division on the Peninsula,
killed, wounded and missing, the last being mostly
killed, exceeded 8000.</p>

<p>After the evacuation, 8th January, 1916, the
Division had a short stay at Mudros and was then
taken to Egypt.</p>

<p>In Sir A. Murray’s despatch of 1st October,
1916, dealing with operations east of the Canal, he
stated that of the East Lancashire troops commanded
by Major-General Sir W. Douglas, only
two battalions were in action on the 4th August, now
the Battle of Rumani, when the Turks were driven
back with heavy loss, but he said that the force
carried out a march under very trying conditions
on the subsequent days.</p>

<p>At no time during their long war-service did the
Division experience a greater physical strain than
on this march. The 52nd on the left were nearer
the coast, with its sea air, and on the whole had
harder going. The two brigades of the 42nd were
wading and struggling in loose desert sand while the
heat was intense. Very many men collapsed. Sir
A. Murray in the despatch, paragraph 5, said:
“Vigorous action, to the utmost limits of endurance
was ordered for the 5th August and the troops,
in spite of the heat, responded nobly.” Certainly
the sufferings of the 127th Brigade on the 5th and
6th bounded on the limits of human endurance.
The 125th had slightly better ground and a shorter
distance. The 126th was in reserve.</p>

<p>The Division, along with the 52nd, alternately
formed the advance guard, in co-operation with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
mounted troops, until the railhead reached El
Arish, when it returned to Kantara. Before the end
of February 1917 it had embarked at Alexandria
for France.</p>

<p>After being re-equipped the Division as part of
the III. Corps, Fourth Army, entered the line in
the Epéhy district and thereafter held a sector
about Havrincourt until 8th July, when they
went out for rest and training in the back area of
the Third Army, about the ground of the First
Battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>In September 1917, the Division took over from
the 15th in the Third Battle of Ypres, in the area
of the Fifth Army. On 6th September they assaulted
several fortified farms, but, in consequence of a
little hill on the left being still in the enemy’s
possession, they failed to make much progress.
Their losses were heavy, partly because the Division
was so persistent in their pursuit of a success.
During the following days they had further fighting.</p>

<p>On the 26th the Division relieved the 66th in the
Coastal Sector at Nieuport. When relieved there
by a French unit in November the 42nd moved to
Givenchy. There they constructed many concrete
defence works which earned the gratitude and
praise of the 55th when the Lys battle opened on
9th April, 1918. See 55th Division.</p>

<p>When, early in 1918, brigades were reduced to
three battalions, any surplus of men or of experience
was transferred to the second line division, the 66th,
a gift which was to be of inestimable value during
the terrible fighting the 66th endured in the March
Retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>About 23rd March, 1918, the 42nd were “bused”
to the Arras-Bapaume area to assist in arresting
the great German offensive. On the 24th they
entered the line about Ervillers, and now had
fighting of the most trying description; the flanks
being often “in the air,” partly because divisions
which had been in the battle since its commencement
on the 21st were almost worn to the bone.</p>

<p>In a supplementary despatch of 23rd April, 1918,
as to the work of different divisions, Sir Douglas
Haig said: “In fierce fighting at end of March and
early in April around Bucquoy and Ablainzevelle
the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division (T.) and 62nd
(West Riding) Division (T.) beat off many attacks
and contributed greatly to the successful maintenance
of our line in this important sector.”</p>

<p>In Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 20th July,
1918, as to the March Retreat, paragraph 33, Third
Army front, he said: “A counter-attack by the
42nd Division, under Major-General A. Solly-Flood
(on 25th March) drove the enemy out of Sapignies,”
and notwithstanding that the Germans maintained
great pressure and made many attacks, the 42nd
Division at end of the day held Ervillers “where
the 1/10th Battalion Manchester Regiment, 42nd
Division, had repulsed eight attacks.” The fighting
24th/25th March is now the “First Battle of
Bapaume, 1918.” Paragraph 42, as to the 26th-27th
March: “Elsewhere all his assaults were heavily
repulsed by troops of the 62nd, 42nd and Guards
Divisions.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 45 deals with the great attack on 28th
March, now officially the “First Battle of Arras,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
1918,” when the fighting was “of the utmost
intensity.” “On the southern portion of his attack
the enemy’s repulse was, if possible, even more
complete than on the new front east of Arras....
The 42nd Division drove off two attacks from the
direction of Ablainzevelle.”</p>

<p>The worst was over and the line now stabilised,
but on the 5th and 6th April the enemy launched
very heavy attacks in the neighbourhood where the
42nd were holding the line. See also 47th Division.
These new attacks were also repulsed. This is now
the “Battle of the Ancre, 1918.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>History of the 42nd Division</cite> by Mr. F. P.
Gibbon (<cite>Country Life</cite> Office, London, 1921, price
6s. 6d.) there is quoted an order by the Commander
of the IV. Corps, Sir G. M. Harper, in which he said:
“The Corps Commander congratulates 42nd Division
on their magnificent behaviour during the last
few days of fighting. Numerous heavy attacks have
been made by the enemy and have been completely
repulsed with heavy loss, and the capture of prisoners
and machine-guns. He heartily thanks the troops
for their courage and endurance, and is confident
that they will continue to hold the line against all
attacks.”</p>

<p>The Divisional Commander also issued a special
order congratulating the Division on their “magnificent
work,” and subsequently in his farewell order,
dated 18th March, 1919, after referring to the
Division being hurried in buses “to help in stemming
the great enemy offensive,” he said: “This
it effectually did in an epic battle, in a manner
which has earned for it undying fame.... For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
seventeen consecutive days it remained in action,
and held its ground in a manner that cannot be
surpassed by the performance of any troops in any
period of history.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gibbon states the losses of the Division
between 24th March and 8th April at 2963. He
makes it clear that on no occasion did the Division
retire except under orders.</p>

<p>Throughout the summer the Division, with brief
intervals, held the line about Gommecourt and
Hebuterne, and when the Third Army attacked,
on 21st August, the Division advanced through
Serre.</p>

<p>The supplementary despatch of 13th September,
1918, said: “The 42nd Division, which, in the
latter days of March, fought with great gallantry
north of Bapaume, took part in the attack launched
by us on the 21st August and in spite of obstinate
resistance by the enemy captured Miraumont.
During the following days it had heavy fighting
on a number of occasions but, before the end of
the month, reached and captured Riencourt-lez-Bapaume.”</p>

<p>This good work was again referred to in the
despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph 21 of
which shows that at 4.55 a.m. on 21st August the
IV. and V. Corps of the Third Army attacked, the
42nd Division being in the assaulting troops of the
IV. Corps. “The enemy’s foremost defences were
carried rapidly and without difficulty.”</p>

<p>The fighting 21st-23rd August is now officially
designated the “Battle of Albert, 1918.” Paragraph
22 deals with the fighting on 23rd and 24th August.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
“Miraumont, which for three days had resisted our
attacks, was taken by the 42nd Division (Major-General
A. Solly-Flood) with many prisoners and,
pressing forward, the same Division seized Pys.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gibbon states that between 21st August and
6th September the Division took 1261 prisoners
and 24 guns, and their casualties were 253 killed
and 1305 wounded.</p>

<p>The fighting 31st August-3rd September is now
the “Second Battle of Bapaume.”</p>

<p>During the remainder of the “Advance to
Victory,” the 42nd alternated with the New Zealand
Division in one of the two divisional sections of the
IV. Corps.</p>

<p>On 27th September the Division attacked and
broke through the portion of the old Hindenburg
line between Havrincourt and Beaucamp. After
two days’ unceasing fighting they were able to claim
over 1700 prisoners and nine field guns. Their own
losses were about 1000.</p>

<p>In paragraph 35 of the despatch “The Battle of
Cambrai and the Hindenburg line, 27th September-5th
October,” Sir Douglas Haig remarked: “The
attack proceeded according to plan from the commencement.
On the right strong resistance was
encountered at Beaucamp. Several strong counter-attacks
were made during the day in this neighbourhood,
but in spite of them troops of the
5th and 42nd Divisions successfully established the
right flank of our attack between Beaucamp and
Ribecourt.”</p>

<p>The fighting 27th September-1st October is
now officially designated the “Battle of the Canal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
du Nord,” and that on 8th-9th October is the
“Battle of Cambrai, 1918.”</p>

<p>During the latter period the Division was resting
about Havrincourt Wood but re-entered the line
on the 12th.</p>

<p>On 20th October at 2 a.m. the Third Army and
a portion of the First Army made an attack on the
line of the Selle river, north of Le Cateau. On this
occasion the Division carried all its four objectives.
The despatch, paragraph 46, deals with the “Battle
of the Selle,” and states: “On this occasion also
the enemy’s resistance was serious, and he had been
able to erect wire entanglements along the greater
part of the line. Our advance was strongly contested
at every point, frequent counter-attacks being
made. Supported by a number of Tanks which
had successfully crossed the river, our infantry after
severe fighting ... gained their objectives on the
high ground east of the Selle, pushing out patrols
as far as the river Harpies.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 47 described another assault made on
the 23rd October, in which the 42nd is included
among the attacking troops. “At the end of the
day the western outskirts of the Forêt de Mormal
had been reached.”</p>

<p>Both on the 20th and the 23rd there was much
bitter and often hand-to-hand fighting. The 42nd
had as its opponents a crack German division,
fresh from reserve, the 25th and part of another,
and success was only attained by a fine exhibition
of skilful tactics and great fearlessness on the part
of the troops. The Divisional R.E. did particularly
well at the crossing of the Selle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The map opposite page 294 of Messrs. Dent’s
edition of <cite>Sir Douglas Haig’s Despatches</cite> shows that
the 42nd Division was among the troops employed
at the Battle of the Sambre, commencing 4th
November. The Division took over from the New
Zealand Division in the Forêt de Mormal and,
becoming the spear-head of the IV. Corps, kept up
the pressure. This was a task of very great difficulty
as the roads through the Forest had been mined and
otherwise destroyed, and off the roads, owing to
continued rain, the ground was a morass. In the
words of a Special Order by the G.O.C. Division
they “forced the passage of the bridgeless River
Sambre in face of severe enemy fire and captured
Hautmont.”</p>

<p>On Armistice day the Division was just east of
the Maubeuge-Avesnes road.</p>

<p>All through the “Advance to Victory” the work
of the 42nd was up to the very high standard they
themselves had set in Gallipoli in 1915, and unofficial
writers have uniformly referred to their services
in that Advance in terms of the highest praise.</p>

<p>In the Farewell Order before referred to Major-General
Solly-Flood said: “From the 21st August
until the Armistice on 11th November it played a
continuous part in the great offensive. We can with
reason be proud of the Division’s share in that
fighting. Its record includes an advance of 64 miles
during which it fought in 12 general actions—each
of several days’ duration. Its captures include 18
towns and villages, over 4,000 prisoners, 37 guns of
all calibre, 122 trench mortars, 455 machine guns
and much other valuable booty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Early in 1918 I set the Division a motto: ‘Go
one better,’ believing the spirit it expressed would
always carry them to success. It has invariably
acted up to that motto, and it is my pride to be
able to say that never has the Division been called
upon to undertake an operation in which it did not
succeed, and never was it set a task which it did not
more than accomplish.”</p>

<p>These are the words of a friendly critic but they
are something more than “faint praise.” To have
so thoroughly satisfied a Regular officer of the
standing of their Commander meant service of great
merit.</p>

<p>The foregoing account had been written and, like
a number of those which follow, had been gone over
by a senior officer of the Division before Mr. Gibbon’s
<cite>History of the 42nd</cite> was published, but the losses and
certain other details concerning 1918 are as given
by Mr. Gibbon. His chronicle gives a full account
of the March battle and of the last Advance, and
claims which he makes, such as that the losses
of the Division were increased because it attained
its objectives up to time and while its flanks were
uncovered, are substantiated by other authorities.</p>

<p class="no-indent">These three divisions sailed for the East early in
the war, chiefly in September 1914, and were among
the first Territorial units to leave Britain. As
regards being mentioned in despatches as divisional
units they were unfortunate, no such references
having been made, but their services to the Empire
were, nevertheless, very great.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that if these three divisions
had been sent to France when they went East, two
months’ intensive training would have fitted them
to be of use in the First Battle of Ypres, certainly
they might have been veterans before the Second.
They would have stood the climatic conditions
much better than the two Indian divisions, and a
vast amount of shipping might have been saved.
Probably political reasons demanded that a representation
from India should appear on the Western
Front, while, as Mr. Churchill said on 1st April,
1919, the Territorial Force was, in many quarters,
hardly regarded seriously as a military factor before
the Great War.</p>

<p>The public has learned that over 20,000
Territorials were still in India in the beginning of
1919 and were not relieved until the close of that
year. Throughout the war, and for a year after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Armistice, the garrison of India was largely composed
of these divisions, but units of all three saw
much heavy fighting in various theatres. It should
be remembered also that facilities for leave did not
exist in the East.</p>

<p>Doubtless imperious necessity compelled the
breaking up of these divisions, and the sending of
a battalion in one direction and its sister units in
others.</p>

<p>In the despatches from India and Mesopotamia
one misses that appreciation, so freely given by Sir
John French to even individual battalions of the
Territorial Force in the early stages of the war on
the western front, and in these Eastern despatches
the letters T.F. are not appended to the names
of battalions. In Lists of Mention, however, this
omission is remedied.</p>

<p>In Sir John Nixon’s despatch of 1st January,
1916, thirty-five officers and men of the Hampshire
Regiment, T.F., were mentioned for good services
on the Euphrates, 26th June to 25th July, 1915.</p>

<p>About the close of 1915 and early in 1916 the
1/4th Hampshire Regiment, 1/4th Somersetshire
Light Infantry and 1/4th Devonshire Regiment, all
of the 43rd, and 1/5th Royal West Surrey and 1/5th
East Kent Regiments of the 44th Division were in
the Mesopotamia Army and had heavy casualties.
Some of the 43rd Division were actually in Kut
when it was besieged and were taken prisoners on
the surrender of General Townshend’s force. Other
battalions of these three divisions sent drafts from
India to Mesopotamia, which were, for the most part,
attached to Regular regiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Officers and other ranks of the 4th East Kent,
4th Devons, 6th Devons, and 2/5th Hampshire were
mentioned in General Maude’s last despatch.</p>

<p>In September 1918, the 1/4th Hampshire of the
43rd was serving in a force which was operating
in Transcaspia.</p>

<p>There was published by the War Office on 13th
January, 1920, a list of names, brought forward
by Lieut.-General W. R. Marshall, K.C.B., for
distinguished and gallant services with the Mesopotamia
Expeditionary Force; the following units
are represented in it:</p>

<p>The 1/5th Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry,
originally of the 43rd, were Pioneers to the 61st
Division in France in March 1918, and a successful
counter-attack by the battalion is referred to in
paragraph 31 of Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 20th
July, 1918.</p>

<p>The 1/7th and 1/8th Middlesex of the 44th served
throughout most of the war with the 56th London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Division in France. The 1/7th was selected for the
Army of the Rhine.</p>

<p>The 2/4th Royal West Surrey, the 2/10th Middlesex
and the 2/4th Royal West Kent of the 67th,
Second Line, Home Counties Division, served with
the 53rd, Welsh, Division and saw much fighting
at Suvla Bay, Gallipoli, and in Palestine. Latterly
the 2/4th West Surrey was in France, and was
selected for the Army of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Sir A. Wilson’s despatch of 1st March, 1916, deals
with operations in Western Egypt at the close of
1915, and the beginning of 1916. He mentions the
2/7th and 2/8th Middlesex, of the 67th Division,
as forming part of the force employed.</p>

<p>When in April 1918 the 52nd Division and other
troops were taken from Palestine to France certain
units of these divisions were brought to Palestine
and along with the Indian troops were engaged in
the last victorious operations in that sphere. Among
the mentions by Sir E. Allenby for good work in
Palestine, March to September 1918, the following
battalions are represented:</p>

<p>The 1/5th Devonshire of the 43rd and the 2/4th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Hampshire of the 45th joined the 62nd Division
in France in June 1918 and were with it until the
Armistice. When the 62nd was with the French
Army on the Ardre, upon the east side of the salient
between the Aisne and the Marne, in July 1918,
these two battalions did work which was highly
spoken of and quite worthy of the famous division
to which they were attached. They gained a large
number of awards in the last five months’ fighting.
This remark applies particularly to the 2/4th
Hampshire, the number of whose awards for work
in France was quite exceptional. As to the 62nd
Division, see <cite>The West Riding Territorials in the
Great War</cite>, Kegan Paul and Co. Both the above
battalions were chosen for the Army of Occupation.</p>

<p>The official lists issued by the War Office in
November 1920 showed that awards were gained by
a non-commissioned officer of the 1/4th East Kent
for valuable service when with the Baluchistan
Force, and by men of the 1/4th and 1/7th Hampshire
for gallant service when with the Waziristan
Force as late as 25th May, 1919.</p>

<p>For the Armies of Occupation there were chosen:
Mesopotamia, the 1/5th East Kent, 1/5th Royal
West Kent and 1/5th East Surrey of the 44th,
and the 1/4th Dorsetshire of the 43rd. For Persia
the 1/4th Hampshire of the 43rd. For Egypt the
1/4th Wiltshire and 1/5th Somerset Light Infantry
of the 43rd, while the 1/8th Hampshire was also
selected for Egypt and the 1/9th (Cyclists) for Siberia.</p>

<p>Although they were never operating as divisions
the units from Wessex and the Home Counties can
at least count themselves as very “far travelled.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="46TH_NORTH_MIDLAND_DIVISION"><span class="allsmcap">46TH</span> (NORTH MIDLAND) DIVISION<br>
<span class="smcap">First Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This Division sailed for France in February 1915.
One brigade was in reserve at the Battle of Neuve
Chapelle, 10th-13th March, see paragraph 4 of the
despatch from Sir John French, dated 5th April, 1915.
In that despatch, paragraph 9, Sir John French said:
“Several T.F. Battalions were engaged in the most
critical moments of the fighting which occurred in
the middle of March and they acquitted themselves
with the utmost credit.” He looked forward to
the T.F. troops being employed as divisions and
said: “These opinions are fully borne out by the
results of the close inspection I have recently made
of the North Midland Division under Major-General
The Hon. Montague-Stuart-Wortley and the 2nd
London Division (afterwards the 47th) under Major-General
Barter.”</p>

<p>This generous appreciation gave great encouragement
not only to those of the Force in France,
but to those who were then preparing themselves
to go abroad, as well as to those who were working
for the Territorial Force at home.</p>

<p>The Division spent the next six months in front
of Neuve Église and in the Ypres salient, and at
times had sharp fighting. It was involved in the
first “Flammenwerfer” attack but stood its ground
and repelled the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>The 46th Division is mentioned in Sir John
French’s last despatch dated 31st July, 1916, as
having on 13th October, 1915, taken part in an
attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Fosse 8,
near Loos. The Division retook the redoubt, but
as they could make no progress up the trenches
to Fosse 8, and as the Redoubt was commanded
from Fosse 8, they were pressed back to the west
edge of the Redoubt where they made a defensive
line.</p>

<p>See also an authorised account by the Press
Association Correspondent written on 24th November,
1915, who was then able to stand on the part
captured and look back over the glacis crossed by
the Division, who had done all that the bravest
could do.</p>

<p>The Division was, in December 1915, ordered to
Egypt; two brigades had arrived there when the
move was countermanded and, in February 1916,
it was concentrated in the Arras district, where it
took over a sector hitherto held by our French allies.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 23rd December,
1916, which deals with the Somme battle, paragraph
8 (Dent’s edition), shows that the 46th and
56th Divisions, VII. Corps, Third Army, made a
subsidiary attack at Gommecourt on 1st July, 1916.
“The subsidiary attack at Gommecourt also forced
its way into the enemy’s positions; but there met
with such vigorous opposition that, as soon as it was
considered that the attack had fulfilled its object,
our troops were withdrawn.”</p>

<p>The losses of both the 46th and 56th Divisions
were very heavy. None of the other divisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
operating north of La Boisselle succeeded in consolidating
the ground gained on 1st July. At that
part of the line the enemy seems to have expected
the attack and had made the most ample preparation
to meet it. The efforts of these divisions,
however, certainly contributed to the success of
those further south.</p>

<p>In March 1917, when there were signs of a German
retreat, the Division was about Bucquoy, as part of
the II. Corps, and at times had sharp fighting and
considerable losses. Thereafter they were taken to
the north of Arras, where they were when the Battle
of Arras opened on 9th April.</p>

<p>The despatch of 25th December, 1917, paragraph
36, Dent’s edition, deals with “Minor Operations”
in the Lens area and states: “Substantial progress
was made in this area on the 5th and 19th June,
and five days later North Midland troops (46th
Division, Major-General W. Thwaites) captured an
important position on the slopes of a small hill
south-west of Lens, forcing the enemy to make a
considerable withdrawal on both sides of the river.”
On 28th June an attack was made by the 46th
Division and the 3rd and 4th Canadian Divisions
on a front of two and a half miles astride the
Souchez river. “All our objectives were gained,”
and 300 prisoners taken.</p>

<p>At that time the Division was in the I. Corps.
Sir A. Conan Doyle states that when they were taken
out on 2nd July, after ten weeks’ continuous service
in the line, none of the battalions were more than
300 strong. The tasks set to their neighbours, the
Canadians, and to the 46th involved almost constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
fighting, many strong positions being assaulted
between the middle of April and the end of June.</p>

<p>The Division remained in the Lens-Givenchy
area for many months. They were frequently engaged
about Givenchy when the enemy made his great
effort in that district in April 1918 (see 55th Division).
They took part in the first advance eastward
which began at the end of August. In September
they were relieved and taken south where on the
19th they joined the IX. Corps, Fourth Army, and
they remained in it till the battle of one hundred
days was closed by the Armistice.</p>

<p>In Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 21st December,
1918, paragraph 36, “The Hindenburg Line broken,”
29th September, he said, “On the Fourth Army
front the 46th Division (Major-General G. F.
Boyd) greatly distinguished itself in the capture
of Bellenglise. The village is situated in the angle
of the Scheldt canal, which, after running in a
southerly direction from Bellicourt, here bends
sharply to the east towards the Le Tronquoy
tunnel. Equipped with life-belts and carrying mats
and rafts, the 46th Division stormed the western
arm of the canal at Bellenglise and to the north of
it, some crossing the canal on footbridges which the
enemy was given no time to destroy, others dropping
down the sheer sides of the canal wall, and having
swum or waded to the far side, climbing up the
farther wall to the German trench lines on the
eastern bank. Having captured these trenches,
the attacking troops swung to the right and took
from flank and rear the German defences along the
eastern arm of the canal, and on the high ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
south of the canal, capturing many prisoners and
German batteries in action before the enemy had
had time to realise the new direction of the attack.
So thorough and complete was the organisation for
this attack, and so gallantly, rapidly and well was
it executed by the troops, that this one division took
on this day over 4000 prisoners and 70 guns.”</p>

<p>This feat of arms seems to be as fine as anything
done in the whole course of the war.</p>

<p>The despatch as published in the <cite>Gazette</cite> speaks
of the 32nd Division passing through the 46th and
taking Lehaucourt and Magny La Fosse, but according
to the history of the 46th<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the 46th captured
these villages which were within their objectives.
The 32nd then passed through them at 5.30 p.m.
and next day took Levergies. The error is corrected
by a note on page 283 of Messrs. Dent’s <cite>Sir Douglas
Haig’s Despatches</cite>.</p>

<p>A detailed account of the battle of 29th September
is given by Major-General Sir Archibald Montgomery
in his <cite>Story of the Fourth Army</cite> (Hodder
and Stoughton). Towards the close of that account
he says: “The success attending the operations of
the IX. Corps was primarily due to the dash and
determination with which the troops of the 46th
Division pressed forward to their objective, and to
the excellent leadership and initiative of the subordinate
commanders. When their flanks were
exposed, they exerted pressure where the enemy was
weak and gave way, and only strengthened their
flanks just sufficiently to safeguard them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The fighting 29th September-2nd October is
now designated the “Battle of St. Quentin Canal.”</p>

<p>The Division captured Ramicourt and broke the
Beaurevoir-Fonsomme line, after stiff fighting, on
3rd October—the “Battle of the Beaurevoir Line.”</p>

<p>One brigade, the 139th, was attached to the 6th
Division, for an attack on 8th October when Mannequin
Hill and other strong positions were captured.
(<cite>Story of Fourth Army</cite>, pp. 194 and 195.)</p>

<p>The Division was in the line on 9th and 10th
October during the “Battle of Cambrai, 1918,”
when rapid progress was made until they were
stopped at Riquerval Wood. They were again employed
in the Battle of the Selle River, 17th-25th
October, see paragraphs 37 and 46 of the despatch.</p>

<p>In his <cite>Breaking the Hindenburg Line</cite>, Major
Priestley gives detailed accounts of the Battle of
Ramicourt, 3rd October, and the Battle of Andigny
or Riquerval, a phase of the Battle of the Selle,
17th and 18th October. He points out that on the
3rd, the 46th not only took Ramicourt but captured
and cleared Montbrehain to the east of it, 1000
prisoners being taken in the latter place; but, in
consequence of the Division on the left of the 46th
having been held up, the latter had to withdraw
from Montbrehain, establishing their line to the
west of it. He also mentions that both on the 3rd
and 17th/18th October, as well as in the preliminary
actions between these dates, the enemy’s resistance
was much more stubborn than at Bellenglise, where
the crossing of the canal had probably upset all
his calculations and temporarily knocked the heart
out of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>The IX. Corps took part in the “Battle of the
Sambre,” 4th November, and continued to move
forward till the 10th November. The 46th Division,
which had been out at rest from 18th October till
1st November, on the night of the 4th relieved
brigades of the 1st and 32nd Divisions and continued
to press and pursue the enemy. On the
evening of the 6th they entered Cartignies and on
the 7th, in face of resistance, crossed the Petite
Helpe. On the 8th they had crossed the La Capelle-Avesnes
road and when the Armistice came the
Division was east of Sains.</p>

<p>The 1/5th South Staffordshire was selected for
the Army of the Rhine.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The 47th Division went to France in March 1915,
and a reference to its being inspected by Sir John
French will be found under the 46th. In his despatch
of 15th June, 1915, Sir John French mentioned
that the First Army made an effort to advance its
line in the Neuve Chapelle-Festubert district during
May, the Battle of Festubert, and said, paragraph
5: “On 24th and 25th May the 47th Division (2nd
London Territorial) succeeded in taking some more
of the enemy’s trenches, and in making good the
ground gained to the east and north.” Various
writers say that in this, the Division’s first big battle,
they made a very fine advance and held the ground
gained against many counter-attacks, during the
succeeding days.</p>

<p>In Sir John French’s despatch of 15th October,
1915, as to the Battle of Loos, etc., he said that the
47th Division was on the extreme right of the British
Army on 25th September. Paragraph 10: “The 47th
Division on the right of the IV. Corps rapidly swung
its left forward and occupied the southern outskirts
of Loos and a big double slag-heap opposite Grenay
known as the Double Crassier. Thence it pushed on
and by taking possession of the cemetery, the
enclosures and chalk pits south of Loos, succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
in forming a strong defensive flank. The London
Territorial Division acquitted itself most creditably.
It was skilfully led and the troops carried out their
task with great energy and determination. They
contributed largely to our success in this part of
the field.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 11: “As the success of the 47th Division
on the right of the IV. Corps caused me less apprehension
of a gap in our line near that point I ordered
the Guards Division up to Nœux-les-Mines.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 15, 27th September: “The 47th Division
on the right of the Guards captured a wood
further to the south and repulsed a severe hostile
counter-attack”; and later: “The Division made a
little more ground to the south, capturing one field
gun and a few machine guns.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 19th May, 1916,
Messrs. Dent’s edition, paragraph 3, shows that the
47th (Major-General Sir C. St. L. Barter) and 25th
Divisions were holding positions on the Vimy Ridge
on 21st May, 1916, when the enemy attacked,
making “a small gain of no strategic or tactical
importance.”</p>

<p>The Division was taken to the Somme, and the
despatch of 23rd December, 1916, paragraph 27
(Dent’s edition), shows that as part of the III.
Corps, Fourth Army, it was in the attack of 15th
September, 1916. “On our left High Wood was
at last carried, after many hours of very severe
fighting, reflecting great credit on the attacking
battalions of the 47th Division.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 31, note, shows the Division was employed
on 1st October, 1916, in a successful attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
on Eaucourt l’Abbaye and the defences east and
west of it.</p>

<p>A week later the Division made an attack on the
Butte de Warlencourt, an extremely strong point,
but were not successful. Already the mud was
making movement almost impossible. The fighting
15th-22nd September is now designated the Battle
of Flers-Courcelette, and that between 1st and
18th October the “Battle of the Transloy Ridges.”</p>

<p>The despatch of 25th December, 1917, paragraph
33 (Dent’s edition), contains an account of the
Messines battle on 7th June, 1917. “Heavy fighting
took place in Wytschaete and further north.
London troops (47th Division, Major-General Sir
G. F. Gorringe) encountered a serious obstacle in
another strong point known as the White Château.
This redoubt was captured while the morning was
yet young.” The 41st and 47th had further resistance
in Ravine Wood, “killing many Germans.” In
this battle the 47th Division was in the X. Corps,
Second Army.</p>

<p>The 47th Division was in the later stages of the
Third Battle of Ypres in the autumn of 1917, see
<cite>History of the 25th Division</cite>, by Col. Kincaid-Smith,
Harrison and Sons, page 94. They were in the undesirable
Glencorse Wood area. About the third
week of August they relieved the 8th Division, and
as part of the II. Corps had heavy fighting about
22nd to 24th August when, at serious cost, their
line was advanced. On 9th September they took
over from the 25th in the same district.</p>

<p>In Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 20th February,
1918, dealing with the “Battle of Cambrai, 1917,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
he said, paragraph 11, German attack of 30th November,
1917: “In the northern area the German
attack was not launched until some two hours later.
This was the enemy’s main attack and was carried
out with large forces and great resolution.”</p>

<p>“After a preliminary bombardment and covered
by an artillery barrage the enemy’s infantry advanced
shortly after 9 a.m. in dense waves, in the
manner of his attack in the first battle of Ypres.
In the course of the morning and afternoon no less
than five principal attacks were made in this area,
and on one portion of the attack as many as eleven
waves of German infantry advanced successively
to the assault. On the whole of this front a resolute
endeavour was made to break down by sheer
weight of numbers the defence of the London
Territorials and other English battalions holding
the sector.”</p>

<p>“In this fighting the 47th (London) Division, T.”
(Major-General Sir G. F. Gorringe) (which had entered
the battle on the night of the 28th-29th November),
“the 2nd Division and the 56th (London)
Division, T., greatly distinguished themselves and
there were accomplished many deeds of great heroism.”
After describing attacks made during the
day, which were driven back, the enemy’s losses
being enormous, the despatch says: “Early in the
afternoon the enemy again forced his way into our
foremost positions in this locality (west of Bourlon),
opening a gap between the 1/6th and 1/15th Battalions,
London Regiment. Counter-attacks led by
the two battalion commanders with all available
men, including the personnel of their headquarters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
once more restored the situation. All other attacks
were beaten off with the heaviest losses to the
enemy.</p>

<p>“The greatest credit is due to the troops at Masnières
(29th Division), Bourlon and Mœuvres for
the very gallant service performed by them on this
day. But for their steady courage and staunchness
in defence the success gained by the enemy on the
right of our battle front might have had serious
consequences.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 13, withdrawal from Bourlon, etc.,
night of 4th/5th December, 1917: “Much skill and
courage were shown by our covering troops in this
withdrawal, and an incident which occurred on the
afternoon of 6th December, in the neighbourhood
of Graincourt, deserves special notice. A covering
party, consisting of two companies of the 1/15th
Battalion London Regiment, 47th Division, much
reduced in strength by the fighting at Bourlon
Wood, found their flank exposed by a hostile attack
further east and were enveloped and practically
cut off. These companies successfully cut their way
through to our advanced line of resistance, where
they arrived in good order after having inflicted
serious casualties on the enemy.” As to the Cambrai
battle see also under 51st, 55th, 56th and 62nd
Divisions.</p>

<p>The Division was moved south, and in January
1918 took over in the Ribecourt area of the Flesquières
salient, east of Havrincourt Wood. As part
of the V. Corps, Third Army, it was involved in the
March Retreat although perhaps not so seriously as
the Fifth Army further south. In his despatch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
20th July, 1918, paragraph 17, speaking of the
events of 21st March, Sir Douglas Haig said: “The
enemy’s advance south and north of the Flesquières
salient rendered a withdrawal by the V. Corps and
by the 9th Division on its right necessary also.”
Orders were issued accordingly. These different
withdrawals were carried out successfully during
the night. Paragraph 21: “The Divisions holding
the Flesquières salient were not seriously involved
during the morning of 22nd March but in the
evening strong attacks were made both at Villers
Plouich and at Havrincourt. All these attacks were
repulsed with great slaughter.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 28, 23rd March: “At the junction of
the Third and Fifth Armies the situation was less
satisfactory and as the day wore on it became
critical.”</p>

<p>As the result of the withdrawal of the VII. Corps,
Fifth Army, a gap was formed between the flanks
of the V. and VII. Corps though “vigorous efforts
were made” by the 47th Division of the V. Corps
and the 2nd of the VII. Corps to establish touch.
These were unsuccessful; consequently, “The right
of the V. Corps was forced back by pressure from the
south-east first to Four Winds Farm, south of Ytres,
where troops of the 47th Division made a gallant
stand until nightfall.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 30, as to 24th March: “The 47th Division
held the village of Rocquiny from sunrise until
well into the afternoon, beating off all attacks
with rifle and machine-gun fire until the enemy
worked round their flank and forced them to
withdraw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>On the 25th the Division, now very exhausted,
was again heavily attacked near Contalmaison but
successfully repulsed the enemy. The retreat was
continued across the Ancre to about Bouzincourt
north of Albert and, with intervals of rest, the
Division remained in that area till the British advanced
in August, although not always exactly in
the same portion of the line.</p>

<p>The fighting 21st-23rd March is now designated
the “Battle of St. Quentin,” and that on the 24th-25th
the “First Battle of Bapaume.”</p>

<p>The Division was engaged near Albert when the
enemy attacked the four British Divisions in that
neighbourhood, 4th, 5th, and 6th April, the “Battle
of the Ancre, 1918.” The attack was pressed by
large forces with great vigour and determination,
but the line, though dented, remained unbroken.
The depleted and weary ranks of the 47th responded
to every call.</p>

<p>In his <cite>Fifth Army in March 1918</cite> (John Lane,
1921), perhaps the most searching, fearless, and
able work published in Britain on the war on
land, Mr. Sparrow comments on those passages of
the despatch which deal with the withdrawal from
the Flesquières salient and the subsequent loss of
connection between the Third and Fifth Armies.
Mr. Sparrow thinks that the gap was caused primarily
by the delay on the part of the V. Corps
in withdrawing from the salient, and secondly because
that corps, of which the 47th was the right
division, tended north from the boundary line previously
laid down by G.H.Q. He shows that the
VII. Corps of the Fifth Army, although hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
pressed, did its best to maintain connection, and
with that object crossed the boundary into Third
Army ground. He concludes that the northward
trend of the V. Corps was partly attributable to the
break in the Third Army front about Lagnicourt.
Doubtless this was the case. Certainly the Third
Army was in very serious difficulties between the
21st and 29th, and its withdrawals were sometimes
more rapid and carried further than those of the
Fifth. To assume that all the “breaks” were on
the front of the Fifth is to ignore the despatch
itself.</p>

<p>In his telegraphic despatch of 13th September,
1918, as to the work of various divisions, Sir Douglas
Haig said: “The 47th was continuously engaged
in March throughout the retreat, fighting successful
rearguard actions from La Vacquerie to Albert.
Going into line on August 13th, in the neighbourhood
of Morlancourt, it fought its way forward to
St. Pierre-Vaast Wood, which it cleared of the
enemy, overcoming fierce hostile resistance and
capturing many prisoners and several guns in
the course of its advance. Included among the
latter was a German field gun battery which
was rushed while in action firing over open
sights.”</p>

<p>The Division was then in the III. Corps, Fourth
Army.</p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
21, shows that the III. Corps including the 47th,
12th and 18th Divisions attacked on 22nd August,
during the “Battle of Albert, 1918”; the 3rd
Australian and 38th Divisions co-operated. The left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of the Fourth Army was brought forward and over
2400 prisoners and a few guns were taken.</p>

<p>Paragraph 22. The III. Corps again attacked on
the 23rd and progress was made. At 1 a.m. on the
24th the latter was renewed, the 3rd Australian
Division took Bray-sur-Somme and the 47th, 12th,
and 18th Divisions carried the line across the high
ground between Bray and La Boisselle and took
prisoners.</p>

<p>Paragraph 24. In support of the operation against
Mont St. Quentin “on the morning of 31st August
the left of the Fourth Army (3rd Australian Division,
58th London, 47th and 18th) attacked towards
Bouchavesnes, Rancourt and Frégicourt, and
by successful fighting on this and the following
day, captured these villages and several hundred
prisoners.” The fighting 31st August-3rd September
is now the “Second Battle of Bapaume.” See
also under 58th Division.</p>

<p>In the <cite>History of the Fourth Army</cite> (Hodder and
Stoughton) there will be found an account which
correlates the doings of the III. Corps and the
Australian Corps in the fighting between 22nd
August and 4th September. On several occasions
the task of the 47th Division was a very hard one
as at the “Happy Valley” on 22nd August and
subsequently. At page 111 there occurs the following
sentence: “The operations of the III. Corps
were also worthy of the highest praise. The advance
of this Corps from the capture of Albert on August
22nd, until they crossed the Canal du Nord on
September 4th, covers a distance, as the crow flies,
of some fourteen miles, over the desolate, shell-pitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
area of the old Somme battlefields. The
operations require to be studied in greater detail
than is possible here before the magnitude of the
task the troops were asked to perform, and the
demands on the officers and men which such an
advance in face of determined opposition entailed,
can be fully realised. The spirit, however, of the
young soldiers of the 12th, 18th, 47th and 58th
Divisions successfully overcame every difficulty,
and well did they answer every call made on them,
and uphold the best traditions of the British
soldier by their cheerfulness and endurance.”</p>

<p>The Division left the III. Corps on 7th September
and moved north to join the Fifth Army, and it
was not thereafter in any hard-fought battle.
Shortly thereafter Headquarters of the III. Corps
also moved north to the Flanders area, where they
were employed during the closing weeks.</p>

<p>For a time the 47th was in the line in the Lys area
and after a short rest moved through Armentières
to Lille, and, continuing to press and follow up the
enemy, the Division was east of Tournai when the
Armistice was concluded.</p>

<p>At Loos, in September 1915, the 47th Division
had earned and received the praise of the Commander-in-Chief,
Sir John French. In the next big
battle—the Somme—at High Wood, September
1916, it had fought so well as again to be commended
by the then Commander-in-Chief, Sir Douglas Haig,
and at Bourlon Wood on 30th November, 1917, it
“greatly distinguished” itself. Few if any divisions
in the British Army received such recognition
on three separate occasions. This most brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
reputation remained, as will be seen from the foregoing
extracts, absolutely untarnished to the end.</p>

<p>The 1/6th London Regiment, originally belonging
to the 56th, but which served with the 47th Division,
was selected for the Army of the Rhine.</p>

<span class="smcap">First Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The 48th Division sailed for France in March 1915.
The outstanding features in their war experiences
are their long and memorable services in the Battle
of the Somme in 1916, and in the Third Battle of
Ypres, 1917, and their most successful advance in
Italy in the last few days of the war with Austria.</p>

<p>The Division was present as part of the VIII.
Corps at the Somme on 1st July, when the battle
commenced, but fortunately for them they were in
support that day and had an opportunity of learning
from the misfortunes of the divisions in the front
rank at that part of the line. The fighting 1st-13th
July is now designated the “Battle of Albert, 1916.”
About 15th July the Division was transferred to
the III. Corps.</p>

<p>On 16th July the 143rd Brigade made a very fine
advance in the “Battle of Bazentin Ridge,” and
the capture of Ovillers was completed, the Division
securing ground to the north and east of the village.
During the ensuing fortnight the Division had
constant and very heavy fighting.</p>

<p>Pozières was the next objective. The Australians
attacked from the south on 23rd July and the 48th
on their left from the south-west. Both attacks
were pushed home with splendid resolution and by
the 29th July the 48th had secured its objectives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
north of the village. On the 27th the 145th Brigade
did exceptionally well. After a short rest the
Division was, about 10th August, again in the line,
pushing towards the ridge. A strong counter-attack
was driven back on the 17th and on the 18th the
143rd Brigade captured a big stretch of trenches and
600 prisoners. The fighting 23rd July-3rd September
is now designated the “Battle of Pozières Ridge.”
There were few tougher struggles in the whole course
of the war.</p>

<p>When the arrival of winter and oceans of mud
made offensive operations an impossibility, the
Division, as part of the III. Corps, was still on the
Somme.</p>

<p>In the despatch of 23rd December, 1916, paragraph
14 (Dent’s edition), Sir Douglas Haig said:
“On the 16th July a large body of the garrison of
Ovillers surrendered, and that night and during the
following day, by a direct advance from the west
across No Man’s Land, our troops (48th Division,
Major-General R. Fanshawe) carried the remainder
of the village and pushed out along the spur to the
north and eastwards towards Pozières.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 17: “An assault delivered simultaneously
on this date—23rd July—by General Gough’s
Army (1st Australian Division and 48th Division)
against Pozières gained considerable results, and by
the morning of 25th July the whole of that village
was carried, including the cemetery, and important
progress was made along the enemy’s trenches to
the north-east.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 19: “Apart from the operations already
described others of a minor character, yet involving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
much fierce and obstinate fighting, continued during
this period (August). Our lines were pushed forward,”
etc. Among the troops mentioned in a note
as engaged was the 48th Division.</p>

<p>In February 1917 the enemy opposite Gough’s
Fifth Army commenced to withdraw, and early in
March the Fourth Army found a similar movement
commencing on their front. The 48th were then in
the Fourth Army.</p>

<p>The despatch of 31st May, 1917, as to the German
Retreat, paragraph 13 (Dent’s edition), states: “At
7 a.m. on the 18th March our troops (48th Division,
Major-General R. Fanshawe) entered Peronne and
occupied Mont St. Quentin, north of the town.”
Paragraph 16 shows that the Division “after fighting
of some importance” on 4th and 5th April took
part in the capture of Ronssoy and other villages.
At this time the Division formed part of the XV.
Corps, Fourth Army. In the <cite>History of the Fourth
Army</cite> by Major-General Sir A. Montgomery (Hodder
and Stoughton) at page 93, the Advance to Peronne,
on 29th August, 1918, there is a note which says that
the whole ground was familiar to the Fourth Army
as they had crossed it in the early spring of 1917.
“The first troops to reach the eastern bank on that
occasion had been those of the 48th Division. They
had secured Biaches and La Maisonette and then,
forcing a crossing where the embankment of the
Canal du Nord crossed the Somme south-west of
Halle, had seized Mont St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>The despatch of 25th December, 1917, Third
Battle of Ypres, as to the attack on the 16th August
(Dent’s edition), states, paragraph 46: “On the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
centre West Lancashire Territorials and troops from
other English Counties (48th and 11th Divisions)
established themselves on a line running north
from St. Julien to the old German third line due
east of Langemarck. This line they maintained
against the enemy’s attacks and thereby secured
the flank of our gains further north.” Officially
this is the Battle of Langemarck, 1917.</p>

<p>Paragraph 54, as to the attack on 4th October:
“On the left of our attack South Midland troops
(48th Division) forced their way across the valley
of the Stroombeek, in spite of difficulties due to
the rain of the previous night, and gained their
objectives according to programme, with the exception
of a single strong point at the limit of
their advance.” Officially this is now the Battle of
Broodseinde.</p>

<p>Paragraph 56, as to the attack on 9th October:
“Australian troops, East Lancashire, Yorkshire and
South Midland Territorials (66th, 49th and 48th
Divisions) carried our line forward in the direction
of Passchendaele and up the western slopes of the
main ridge capturing Nieuwemolen,” etc. Officially
this attack is now the Battle of Poelcappelle.</p>

<p>During these operations the Division was in the
XVIII. Corps. No division had a longer spell of
the great struggle known as the Third Battle of
Ypres, and to say that any did better would be
making a bold claim. They were in support on the
opening day, 31st July, and apart from the actions
mentioned in the above extracts, they made
successful advances on 19th, 22nd and 27th August
and had heavy fighting on many other days, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
they endured very great hardships for nearly three
months.</p>

<p>Before the close of 1917, the Division, along with
other troops, was taken to Italy to assist in arresting
the Austrian invasion. In the Earl of Cavan’s
despatch of 14th September, 1918, as to the operations
of the British Army in Italy, he said: “Early
in the morning of June 15th, after a short but
violent bombardment, in which smoke and gas
were freely employed, the Austrian attack was
launched. The fronts of attack extended from St.
Dona di Piave to the Montello on the plains and from
Grappa to Canove in the mountains, fronts of 25
miles and 18 miles respectively. The whole of the
British sector was involved.</p>

<p>“The British front was attacked by four Austrian
divisions. It was held by the 23rd Division on the
right and the 48th Division on the left. On the
front of the 23rd Division the attack was completely
repulsed. On the front of the 48th Division
the enemy succeeded in occupying our front trench
for a length of some 3000 yards and subsequently
penetrated to a depth of 1000 yards. Here he was
contained by a series of switches which had been constructed
to meet this eventuality. On the morning
of June 16th the 48th Division launched a counter-attack
to clear the enemy from the pocket he had
gained. This attack was completely successful and
the entire line was re-established by 9 a.m.</p>

<p>“Acting with great vigour on the 16th both divisions
took advantage of the disorder in the enemy’s
ranks and temporarily occupied certain posts in the
Asiago plateau without much opposition. Several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
hundred prisoners and many machine guns and two
mountain howitzers were brought back in broad
daylight without interference. As soon as No Man’s
Land had been fully cleared of the enemy we withdrew
to our original line. The enemy suffered very
heavy losses in their unsuccessful attack. In addition
we captured 1060 prisoners, seven mountain
guns, 72 machine guns, 20 flammenwerfer and one
trench mortar.”</p>

<p>In a telegram of 3rd November Lord Cavan mentioned
that the 48th Division was advancing on the
Asiago plateau and had taken 100 guns.</p>

<p>In his despatch of 15th November, 1918, as to the
concluding operations on the Italian front, Lord
Cavan stated, paragraph 30, that the 48th Division,
Major-General Sir H. B. Walker, K.C.B., D.S.O., had
been employed on the Asiago plateau as part of
the 6th Italian Army. It formed part of the XII.
Italian Corps. “Successful raids were carried out
on the 4th, 11th and 23rd October, which resulted
in the capture of 445 prisoners and 12 machine guns.”</p>

<p>Raids and patrols on 29th and 30th October found
that the enemy were moving back, and a general
advance of the 6th Italian Army was ordered. The
48th British and a French Division were the first to
move. On 1st November the 4th Royal Berkshire
Regiment captured Mont Catz.</p>

<p>“On the morning of 2nd November the success
gained on Mont Catz by the 145th Infantry Brigade
was widely exploited. Mont Mosciagh was in the
hands of the 48th Division by 7.30 a.m. and the
Interrotto position was thus outflanked. The advance
then became more rapid, and by dark the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
advanced guards had reached Vezzena, and thus set
foot on Austrian soil. This Division was therefore
the first British division to enter enemy territory
on the western front.” The 4th Berkshire was part
of the 145th Brigade.</p>

<p>“On the morning of 3rd November the advance
was again resumed and by dark both Caldonazzo
and Levico had been occupied.</p>

<p>“At 3 p.m. on 4th November when the Armistice
(with Austria) came into force, the leading troops
were on the line Miola-eastern outskirts of
Trent.</p>

<p>“The captures in prisoners and guns made by
the 48th Division cannot be accurately ascertained:
they amounted to at least 20,000 prisoners and 500
guns. Included amongst the prisoners were the
Commander of the III. Corps and three Divisional
Commanders.</p>

<p>“It must be remembered that this division was
attacking very formidable mountain positions with
only a fifth part of the artillery that would have
been at its disposal had the initial attack started
on the Altipiano. Its performance therefore in
driving in the enemy’s rearguards so resolutely
while climbing up to heights of 5000 feet, is all the
more praiseworthy.</p>

<p>“During these operations the leadership of
Brigadier-General G. C. Sladen, C.M.G., D.S.O.,
M.C., commanding the 143rd Infantry Brigade,
was particularly noticeable.</p>

<p>“31. The infantry had been waiting for an
opportunity to show that they could worthily
emulate the performances of their comrades in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
France. When the opportunity came they fulfilled
my highest anticipations.”</p>

<p>Lord Cavan’s despatch of 15th November, 1918,
paragraph 2, shows that three battalions of the
48th Division were taken to France on 13th/14th
September of that year. These were the 1/8th
Royal Warwickshire Regiment, 1/5th Gloucestershire
Regiment, and 1/8th Worcestershire Regiment.
They formed the reconstituted 75th Brigade
in the 25th Division, which, after being sadly battered
in the March Retreat, the Lys Battle of April
and the German offensive on the Aisne at the end of
May, had been withdrawn from the line and formed
anew. The Division was concentrated in front of
Combles on 3rd October and on the 4th commenced
a hard struggle for the capture of Beaurevoir. This
was completed by the 75th Brigade on the 5th after
two previous attempts had failed. Sir A. Conan
Doyle, vol. vi. p. 174, speaking of this achievement,
says: “Fryell’s 75th Brigade was now assembled
in the dead ground west of Beaurevoir, and at
about 6.30 dashed at it with levelled bayonets and
a determination which would take no denial. The
enemy were swept out of it and the line carried
forward 500 yards to the east of it.” Another
account of the operation will be found at pp. 187
and 188 of <cite>The Story of the Fourth Army</cite>, and it is
there remarked: “Perhaps the outstanding feature
of the operations was the daylight attack of the
1/5th Gloucestershire and the 1/8th Worcestershire,
which finally captured Beaurevoir village.”
At p. 198 of that work it is stated that the same
brigade and a brigade of the 66th captured Maretz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
on the 9th. At p. 227 there is an account of a battle
on 18th October when the 75th Brigade, which was
temporarily attached to the 50th Division, again
got credit by its capture of La Roux Farm and
Bazuel and some heavy guns. P. 234 shows that
the Brigade did fine work on the 23rd when the
1/8th Worcestershire captured Tilleuls Farm and
a battery of howitzers.</p>

<p>On 4th November, the day on which the last
battle of the war commenced, the Brigade gained
great distinction by its capture of Landrecies, which
involved the crossing of an unfordable canal. A
detailed account will be found at p. 252 of <cite>The
Story of the Fourth Army</cite>, and, regarding it, Major-General
Montgomery says: “The capture of Landrecies
was an operation beset with many difficulties,
but, thanks to good leadership, the bravery
of the troops, and the skill and devotion of the
divisional engineers and pioneers, the 75th Brigade
met with the success and good fortune which such
a well planned and boldly executed operation
deserved.”</p>

<p><cite>The History of the 25th Division</cite> (Harrison) also
gives details of the splendid work of the 75th Brigade
between 5th October and the close. See also
the despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraphs
37, 42, 47 and 50.</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable that in the short space of
five weeks two men of the Brigade won the Victoria
Cross.</p>

<p>The 1/7th Royal Warwickshire Regiment and
1/6th Gloucestershire Regiment were selected for
the Army of Occupation, Egypt.</p>

<span class="smcap">First Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Division sailed for France in April 1915, and
before the end of that month entered the line about
Fleurbaix as part of the IV. Corps, First Army.</p>

<p>In the Battle of Aubers Ridge, 9th and other days
of May 1915, the Division held most of the Corps
line while the 7th and 8th Divisions attacked.</p>

<p>About the end of June the Division was transferred
to the VI. Corps, Second Army, and thereafter
did six months’ arduous work in the Ypres
salient.</p>

<p>In January 1916 the Division marched to Calais,
whence, in February, they were railed to near
Amiens. During the ensuing five months they held
trenches in the Authuille-Thiepval district and
did much work in preparation for the great battle.
They were now in the Fifth Army, at first in the
X. Corps, afterwards in the II.</p>

<p>From 1st July, 1916, when the Battle of the
Somme opened, to nearly the end of September,
they were almost constantly engaged, the task of
the Fifth Army being to maintain vigorous pressure,
and so facilitate the advance of the Fourth Army on
its right. On the Division leaving the Fifth Army
the Corps Commander expressed himself as gratified
by their spirit and work.</p>

<p>The despatch from Sir Douglas Haig of 23rd
December, 1916, paragraph 8, deals with the attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
on Thiepval and other strongly fortified positions on
1st July, a phase of the “Battle of Albert, 1916,”
and in Messrs. Dent’s edition, p. 26, there is a note
in the following terms: “In the course of this fighting
a brigade of the 49th Division, Major-General E. M.
Percival, made a gallant attempt to force Thiepval
from the north.” The Division or one or other of
the brigades was engaged in several subsequent
actions in the Somme campaign of 1916.</p>

<p>The Division was taken north again in October
to the Ypres area where it was to be employed for
nearly two years. In July 1917 the Division moved
from the Merville district to Nieuport where they
experienced a particularly bad month. The hostile
bombardment was ceaseless, and the troops in the
line crowded in a very circumscribed space north of
the Canal suffered very heavily. In the beginning
of October the Division entered the main battle in
the Ypres salient and took part in several attacks
under most trying conditions; these were characteristic
of the Third Battle of Ypres. A quotation
as to the attack of 9th October, the Battle of Poelcappelle,
has already been given under the 48th
Division, who were on the left of the 49th, the 66th
being on their right.</p>

<p>In November the Division was in the line in the
Menin Road area, and although the great battle
had died down losses from the unceasing shell fire
kept high, while the physical sufferings from mud
and cold were almost beyond the endurance of the
strongest.</p>

<p>In January 1918, when brigades were cut down
from four to three battalions, the 1/8th West Yorkshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Regiment, 1/5th West Riding Regiment and
the 1/5th The King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry
were taken from the 49th and sent to the 62nd, the
second line West Riding Division.</p>

<p>The 49th was still in the Ypres salient in the
beginning of April 1918. Few divisions had a
more intimate acquaintance with its shell-fire and
mud.</p>

<p>The Division gained great distinction in the battles
about the Lys river in April when the British were
“fighting with their backs to the wall.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From 10th
April till the end of that month one or other of the
three brigades was almost daily engaged, on the
northern side of the salient, which the enemy had
made after overwhelming the Portuguese division
on the 9th. The task of the 49th and other divisions
near them was to stem his rush and prevent him
spreading out to the north and west. If he had
succeeded in gaining more ground to the north,
Ypres would have gone.</p>

<p>In his written despatch of 20th July, 1918, as to
these events Sir Douglas Haig said, paragraph 59,
12th April: “Troops of the 25th, 34th and 49th
Divisions although heavily attacked maintained
their positions to south and south-east of Bailleul.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 60, 13th April: German troops had
entered Neuve Église, “but before noon were driven
out by troops of the 33rd and 49th Divisions in a
most successful counter-attack in which a number
of prisoners were taken.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 64: “At different times on the 16th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
April a number of strong local attacks were made
by the enemy on the Meteren-Wytschaete front,
which were for the most part repulsed with heavy
loss by the 25th, 34th and 49th Divisions.... The
enemy’s attacks in the Kemmel sector (17th April)
were pressed with great determination, but ended in
his complete repulse at all points by troops of the
34th, 49th and 19th Divisions, his infantry being
driven out by counter-attacks wherever they had
gained a temporary footing in our line.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 67 describes the fierce fighting on 25th
and 26th April when the enemy captured Kemmel
Hill. Speaking of the 25th, Sir Douglas Haig said
the enemy’s attacks were renewed in great strength,
and after a violent bombardment. “The weight
of the attack in the British sector fell on the 9th
Division and attached troops of the 49th Division,
who at 7 a.m. were still holding their positions
about Wytschaete intact, though heavily engaged.
Fierce fighting continued in this neighbourhood
for some hours later, and great numbers of Germans
were killed by rifle and machine-gun fire at short
range. Later in the morning the right of the 9th
Division was forced to fall back fighting stubbornly
to Vierstraat, but at 1 p.m. our troops still held
the Grand Bois north of Wytschaete.”</p>

<p>The 49th was heavily engaged on the 26th. “A
very gallant counter-attack by the 25th Division
with attached troops of the 21st and 49th Divisions,
undertaken in conjunction with the French, penetrated
into Kemmel village, taking over 300
prisoners. Our troops then found themselves
exposed to heavy machine-gun fire from the flanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and were unable to maintain their positions. Later
in the morning the enemy renewed his attacks in
strength but in spite of repeated efforts was only
able to make small progress at certain points.
Troops of the 21st, 30th, 39th and 49th Divisions
and the South African Brigade of the 9th Division
had heavy fighting and made several gallant counter-attacks.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 68, 29th April: “The enemy’s advance
stayed.” “On the British front the positions held
by the 21st, 49th and 25th Divisions were strongly
attacked between 5 a.m. and 5.30 a.m. On the
failure of these attacks bodies of German infantry
advanced at 6 a.m. in mass formation with bayonets
fixed against the 49th Division and were repulsed
with the heaviest losses....</p>

<p>“During the morning repeated attacks were made
without result against the 25th and the 49th....
At all points the attack was pressed vigorously
with massed bodies of troops and the losses suffered
by the German infantry were very great. Throughout
the whole of the fighting our infantry and
artillery fought magnificently, and in more than
one instance our troops went out to meet the German
attack and drove back the enemy with the
bayonet. At the end of the day except for a small
loss of ground at Voormezeele our line was intact
and the enemy had undergone a severe and decided
check.” The French retook Locre on the 30th,
and the enemy’s great offensive was ended.</p>

<p>On 2nd May telegrams, sent by Sir Douglas
Haig to the G.O.C. Second Army, congratulating
certain divisions, were published. One of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
referred to the 49th Division and was as follows:
“I desire to express my appreciation of the very
valuable and gallant service performed by troops
of the 49th Division since its entry into the battle
north of Armentières. The courage and determination
shown by this Division have played no small
part in checking the enemy’s advance, and I wish
you to convey to the General Officer Commanding,
and to all officers and men under his command,
my thanks for all that they have done.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig several times, in the course of
his written despatch, refers to the splendid conduct
of the troops engaged in the Lys battle. The enemy
employed 42 divisions of which 33 were “fresh,”
while 9 had come from the Somme. The British
had 25 divisions of which only 8 had not been in
the furnace of the Somme. Further it has to be kept
in view that, as many divisions were sent from the
northern to the southern area during the March
retreat, the work of and strain upon those left in
the north, such as the 49th, were greatly increased:
these were thus not “fresh” in the sense that the
enemy’s forces were “fresh.” French assistance
was of the utmost value in finally convincing the
enemy that his offensive was a failure, but that
assistance could not come until after the battle
had raged for a full week.</p>

<p>In paragraph 70 Sir Douglas Haig remarked:
“Both by them (the divisions brought from the
Somme) and by the divisions freshly engaged every
yard of ground was fiercely disputed, until troops
were overwhelmed or ordered to withdraw. Such
withdrawals as were deemed necessary in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of the battle were carried out successfully and in
good order.</p>

<p>“At no time, either on the Somme or on the Lys,
was there anything approaching a breakdown of
command or a failure of morale. Under conditions
that made rest and sleep impossible for days together,
and called incessantly for the greatest
physical exertion and quickness of thought, officers
and men remained undismayed, realising that for
the time being they must play a waiting game,
and determined to make the enemy pay the full
price for the success which for the moment was
his.”</p>

<p>When one reads the detailed accounts of the
work done by any of the divisions on the Lys one is
filled with wonder and amazement at the power of
endurance, the unbending and self-sacrificing spirit
and technical efficiency of units, many of which
had suffered a 50 per cent. loss a fortnight or less
before the 9th April, and were to the extent of a
full half composed of lads sent to France after
22nd March.</p>

<p>The 49th Division was moved to the south and
joined the XXII. Corps at the end of August 1918.
On 12th September they relieved the 51st in the
Plouvain sector, east of Arras. They took part in
the last great advance. Along with the Canadian
Corps they were engaged in an attack on 11th
October, north-east of Cambrai. On that date the
fighting was stiff and the losses were severe, but
on the 12th good progress was made. The advance
continued on 20th October and the XXII. Corps
drove the enemy across the Selle and the Écaillon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
rivers and in the last week of October were up
against the Rhonelle position.</p>

<p>In Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 21st December,
1918, paragraph 49, the Battle of the Sambre,
1st to 11th November, he says: “During these
two days, 1st and 2nd November, the 61st, 49th
(Major-General N. J. G. Cameron) and 4th Divisions
crossed the Rhonelle river, capturing Maresches
and Preseau after a stubborn struggle, and established
themselves on the high ground two miles to
the east of it. On their left the 4th Canadian
Division captured Valenciennes and made progress
beyond the town. As a consequence of this defeat
the enemy on the 3rd November withdrew on the
Le Quesnoy-Valenciennes front.”</p>

<p>The following battalions were chosen for the
Army of the Rhine: 1/5th and 1/6th West Yorkshire
Regiment, 1/5th Yorkshire Light Infantry
and 1/4th York and Lancaster Regiment.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The 50th Division will always be associated with
the Second Battle of Ypres, now designated “The
Battles of Ypres, 1915,” which began on 22nd April,
1915, by a great discharge of gas, then seen and
felt for the first time in warfare, and which lasted
till 25th May. Their presence was of the utmost
value when the British and French only held on
with the very greatest difficulty and at tremendous
cost. Some battalions of the Division had only
arrived in France a few days before the commencement
of the battle.</p>

<p>In his despatch of 31st May, 1915, Sir John French
“mentioned” officers and men of the following
battalions of the 50th Division: 4th, 5th and 6th
Northumberland Fusiliers and 5th, 6th and 8th
Durham Light Infantry.</p>

<p>In his despatch of 15th June which deals with
the Second Battle of Ypres Sir John French said,
paragraph 4: “During the night” (of the 22nd April)
“I directed the Cavalry Corps and the Northumbrian
Division, which was then in general reserve,
to move to the west of Ypres, and placed these
troops at the disposal of the General Officer commanding
the Second Army.”</p>

<p>The fighting on 22nd-23rd April is now the
“Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge.”</p>

<p>On the 24th April the 9th Durham Light Infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and other battalions of the Division had very heavy
fighting. Several had been detached to assist the
old Regular brigades to hold the line, and all the
battalions of the 50th were in the thick of the
struggle during the ensuing four weeks, either in
their own brigades or attached to others. The
pressure was so great and so continuous, and reserves
so scanty, that even the Regular Divisions had
constantly to detach units to help neighbours in
distress. On 24th May when the enemy made his
final big effort the 151st (Durham Light Infantry)
Brigade were near Hooge and did most valuable
and gallant service.</p>

<p>After describing the heavy and often “hand-to-hand”
fighting on the 23rd, 24th and 25th April,
when the enemy put forth his utmost strength to
break the line, while it was yet dazed by the gas,
Sir John French said, as to the 26th: “On the right
of the Lahore Division the Northumberland Infantry
Brigade” (the 149th) “advanced against St. Julien
and actually succeeded in entering, and for a time
occupying, the southern portion of the village.
They were, however, eventually driven back, largely
owing to gas, and finally occupied a line a short
way to the south. This attack was most successfully
and gallantly led by Brigadier-General Riddell,
who, I regret to say, was killed during the progress
of the operation.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the 151st Brigade was unable to
support the attack as, at the time, they were
engaged in assisting the 28th Division to repel
an attack by the enemy further south, and the
150th were also fighting elsewhere. The fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
24th April-4th May is now the “Battle of St.
Julien.”</p>

<p>The losses of the Division were very heavy,
exceeding 2500 in the first five days alone.</p>

<p>Towards the close of his despatch Sir John French
mentioned that several Territorial Divisions had
in the period under review been employed as
divisional units and had “all borne an active and
distinguished part, and had proved themselves
thoroughly reliable and efficient.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 23rd December,
1916, as to the Somme battle, paragraph 27 (Dent’s
edition, note and map, p. 41), shows that the 50th
Division was employed in the attack of 15th September,
officially the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, it being
then in the III. Corps, Fourth Army. The attack
was successful and a big gain of ground was made.
The map opposite p. 43 shows that the Division
was again in the attack of 25th and 26th September,
the Battle of Morval, when another section of the
German defensive system was bitten off.</p>

<p>During October the Division had, frequently,
bitter fighting in the Eaucourt-Le Sars area, the
Battle of the Transloy Ridges, when further ground
was gained and made secure. Winter’s arrival found
them still in the mud of that much fought-for region.</p>

<p>The despatch of 25th December, 1917, dealing with
the Battle of Arras, 1917, paragraph 18 (Dent’s
edition) as to 13th and 14th April, states: “In the
centre a Northumberland Brigade of the 50th Division
(Major-General P. S. Wilkinson), advancing in
open order, carried the high ground east of Héninel
and captured Wancourt Tower. Three counter-attacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
against this position were successfully
driven off and further ground was gained on the
ridge south-east of Héninel.” Officially this is the
First Battle of the Scarpe, 1917.</p>

<p>Paragraph 21, as to the attack on 23rd April, the
Second Battle of the Scarpe, 1917: “On the main
front of attack good progress was made at first at
almost all points. By 10 a.m. the remainder of the
high ground west of Chérisy had been captured
by the attacking English brigades (30th and 50th
Divisions).” The enemy made many counter-attacks
“in great force ... and with the utmost
determination regardless of the heavy losses inflicted
by our fire.” Part of the ground gained in
the morning was lost in the afternoon but all was
made good in another assault on the 24th after very
fierce fighting. In the Arras battle the Division
operated with the XVIII. and VII. Corps.</p>

<p>The Division was brought north in October and
entered the line on the north side of the Ypres
salient, where, as part of the XIV. Corps, they had
an indescribably bad time amidst lakes of mud and
water. Movement at the best could only be very
slow, often it was impossible, and thus the losses
of the attacking troops were rendered very heavy.</p>

<p>The despatch of 25th December, 1917, makes frequent
reference to the adverse conditions. In paragraph
55 there is the following sentence: “The year
was far spent. The weather had been consistently
unpropitious, and the state of the ground, in consequence
of the rain and shelling combined, made
movement inconceivably difficult.” After considering
the various factors “affecting the problem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
among them the desirability of assisting our Allies
in the operations to be carried out by them on the
23rd October, in the neighbourhood of Malmaison,
I decided to continue the offensive further and to
renew the advance at the earliest possible moment
consistent with adequate preparation.” The Division
formed part of the assaulting line on 26th
October when ground was gained. This is officially
designated the Second Battle of Passchendaele.</p>

<p>Much rain fell in October and it was only on
ground above the general level that progress could
be made in the various attacks undertaken.</p>

<p>The Division remained in the salient, chiefly
between Houthulst Forest and Passchendaele, for
the next three months.</p>

<p>The despatch of 20th July, 1918, deals with the
German attack in the St. Quentin district which
began on 21st March. Regarding the position west
of St. Quentin, in the centre of the Fifth Army,
on the 22nd, paragraph 22, Sir Douglas Haig said:
“Our troops, fighting fiercely and continuously,
were gradually forced out of the battle zone on the
whole of this front and fell back through the 20th
and 50th Divisions holding the third defensive zone
... in the hope of re-organising behind them.”</p>

<p>“By 5.30 p.m. the enemy had reached the third
zone at different points and was attacking the 50th
Division heavily between Villéveque and Boucly.
Though holding an extended front of some 10,500
yards, the Division succeeded in checking the
enemy’s advance, and by a successful counter-attack
drove him temporarily from the village of
Coulaincourt. At the close of the engagement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
however, the troops of the 50th Division about
Pœuilly had been forced back, and by continued
pressure along the south bank of the Omignon
river the enemy had opened a gap between their
right flank and the troops of the 61st Division.”...
At this gap strong bodies of German troops broke
through the third defensive zone.</p>

<p>As all available reserves at the disposal of the
Fifth Army had been thrown into the fight, the
Army Commander at 11 p.m. on the 22nd issued
orders to withdraw to the Somme. Paragraph 23:
“These withdrawals were carried out under constant
pressure from the enemy, covered by rearguards of
the 20th, 50th and 39th Divisions which were continually
in action with the German troops.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 24 shows that on the 23rd, the Fifth
Army Commander issued orders to cross to the west
side of the Somme. In paragraph 26 it is stated that
“Further north the withdrawal to the west bank
of the Somme was carried out successfully during
the morning and early afternoon, effectively covered
by troops of the 50th Division. By 3.15 p.m. all
troops were across the river, and the bridges, for
the most part, destroyed.” The operations 21st to
23rd March are now designated the Battle of St.
Quentin.</p>

<p>Paragraph 43 deals with the fight for the Rosières
line—the Battle of Rosières—27th March. The
50th Division was in support of “a very gallant
and successful counter-attack” by troops of the 8th
Division.</p>

<p>Paragraph 47 describes the fighting in the Avre
and Luce valleys, 29th, 30th and 31st March, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
says: “In the evening” of the 30th, “a most
successful counter-attack by troops of the 20th and
50th Divisions re-established our line south of the
Luce and captured a number of prisoners.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sparrow in his <cite>Fifth Army</cite> gives a very full
account of the invaluable work of the 50th. He
indicates the opinion that their task was made
heavier than it need have been, through their having
been kept by G.H.Q. too far from the battle zone,
and they had thus to be thrown into a surging
battle immediately after a long and most exhausting
march. Probably there were good reasons why
they should have been located where they were
before the battle began. Mr. Sparrow states that
the line which had to be held by the Division,
22nd-23rd March, was 4000 yards longer than the
frontage mentioned in the despatch; at p. 108 he
makes it 14,500 yards. The fighting was so severe
and continuous that, by the evening of the 27th,
the 4th and 5th Northumberland Fusiliers together
could only muster 200 rifles (see p. 129). Other
units of the Division were also reduced to mere
shadows, which, however, struggled and fought till
the line stabilised, although scarcely able to keep
their limbs moving or their eyes open. Mr. Sparrow
shows conclusively that never did human beings
make a finer effort than did the Fifth Army between
21st March and the early days of April. That they
were successful was almost a miracle and is a lasting
tribute to the spirit of officers and men and the skill
of their leader, General Gough.</p>

<p>When, in the beginning of April, it was seen that
the German offensive from St. Quentin had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
stopped, several divisions, including the 50th, which
during the last ten days of March had never been
out of the awful struggle, were taken north to
Flanders, as a quieter part of the line, where they
might recuperate and assimilate their much needed
drafts. Alas, they were to find themselves in
another furnace.</p>

<p>The Lys battles are dealt with in the despatch
of 20th July, 1918, and it will be remembered that
these began with a great attack on the Portuguese
sector on 9th April, spreading to that of the 40th
Division on their left and that of the 55th at
Givenchy on the right. The 50th had arrived at
Merville behind the Portuguese on the 8th. Their
artillery was not forward. The 51st, also just arrived
from the Somme, were behind the 55th. On the
morning of the 9th the 50th deployed and were soon
engaged, the 51st also moved forward. After the
Portuguese front was broken in, the 55th succeeded
in forming a defensive flank which bending to the
west established touch with the 51st Division. On
the left of the latter were the 50th, but this division
was unable to establish touch with the 40th.</p>

<p>In paragraph 51 Sir Douglas Haig said: “During
the afternoon troops of the 51st and 50th Divisions
(chiefly composed of drafts hurriedly sent up to
join their regiments) were heavily engaged east of
the Lawe river and were gradually pressed back
upon the river crossings. The enemy brought up
guns to close range, and in the evening crossed at
Estaires and Pont Riqueul, but in both cases was
driven back by counter-attacks.”</p>

<p>In paragraph 53, the struggle for Estaires, Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Douglas said: “Early in the morning of the 10th
April the enemy launched heavy attacks covered
by artillery fire about the river crossings at Lestrem
and Estaires, and succeeded in reaching the left
bank at both places; but in each case he was driven
back again by determined counter-attacks by the
50th Division.</p>

<p>“The enemy continued to exercise great pressure
at Estaires and fierce street fighting took place,
in which both sides lost heavily. Machine guns
mounted by our troops in the upper rooms of houses
did great execution on his troops as they moved
up to the attack, until the machine guns were
knocked out by artillery fire. In the evening the
German infantry once more forced their way into
Estaires, and after a most gallant resistance the
50th Division withdrew at nightfall to a prepared
position to the north and west of the town. East
of Estaires” (apparently outside the area of the
50th) “the enemy had already crossed the Lys in
strength.”</p>

<p>In paragraph 56, as to events on the 11th, he said:
“At Estaires, the troops of the 50th Division, tired
and reduced in numbers by the exceptionally heavy
fighting of the previous three weeks, and threatened
on their right flank by the enemy’s advance, south
of the Lys, were heavily engaged. After holding
their positions with great gallantry during the
morning they were slowly pressed back in the
direction of Merville. The enemy employed large
forces on this front in close formation and the
losses inflicted by our rifle and machine-gun fire
were unusually heavy. Our own troops, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
were not in sufficient numbers to hold up his
advance,” etc. Portions of the Division continued
in the fighting line throughout the 12th and 13th
April.</p>

<p>Paragraph 58: “Though our troops had not been
able to prevent the enemy’s entry into Merville their
vigorous resistance combined with the maintenance
of our positions at Givenchy and Festubert had
given an opportunity for reinforcements to build
up our line in this sector.”</p>

<p>The sacrifices of the 50th Division, which were
again very great, were not in vain.</p>

<p>In the supplementary despatch of 23rd April,
1918, as to work of certain divisions, Sir Douglas
Haig said: “The 50th Division, though but recently
withdrawn from a week of continuous fighting
south of the Somme, on April 9th and subsequent
days held up the enemy along the line of the Lys,
and by the stubbornness of its resistance at Estaires
and Merville checked his advance until further
reinforcements could be brought up.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
10, shows that the 50th along with the 8th, 21st, 25th
and 19th Divisions, all very recently engaged in the
struggles in northern France and Flanders, composed
largely of young drafts and “in no condition to take
part in major operations until they had had several
weeks’ rest,” formed the IX. British Corps which was
sent to the Aisne in May 1918, and was involved
in the “intense fighting,” when the enemy, employing
28 divisions, commenced his attack on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
French Sixth Army on the 27th of that month.
The attacks continued till 6th June, the Franco-British
line being forced back. “Throughout this
long period of incessant fighting against greatly
superior numbers the behaviour of all arms of the
British forces engaged was magnificent. What they
achieved is best described in the words of the French
General under whose orders they came, who wrote
of them: ‘They have enabled us to establish a
barrier against which the hostile waves have beaten
and shattered themselves. This none of the French
who witnessed it will ever forget.’”</p>

<p>In <cite>The History of the 25th Division</cite>, p. 250, speaking
of their arrival in Champagne, there occurs
the following sentences: “To the few in the 25th
Division who had served with the original British
Expeditionary Force in August and September,
1914, the district brought memories of the Battle
of the Marne and the subsequent advance to the
Aisne; but no hint was given of the extent of the
tragedy shortly to be enacted over this historic
ground.</p>

<p>“The front of about 24,000 yards held by the
IX. British Corps ran along the high ground about
four miles north of the Aisne for the first” (left)
“16,000 yards gradually bending S.E., on its right,
to the important point of Berry-au-Bac, where the
line crossed the river and continued on S.E. in the
direction of Rheims for another 8000 yards. The
right sector south of the Aisne was held by the 21st
Division, in touch with the 36th French Division
on its right; the 8th Division in the centre, and the
50th Division to the left, joining up with the 22nd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
French Division of the XI. French Corps, north
of Craonne.”</p>

<p>The 50th, according to all accounts, put up a
glorious defence. Its position made a withdrawal
impracticable, even if that had been contemplated;
it was overwhelmed where it stood. As a fighting
force the Division was practically destroyed; to it
little more remained than the splendid tradition it
had created.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, vol. v., chapter xi.,
gives an excellent description, with many interesting
details, of the magnificent stand made on 27th May,
by the 50th, 8th, and 21st Divisions, aided each
by a brigade of the 25th, and of the intense fighting
which occurred down to 6th June when the enemy’s
effort was spent. As on the Somme and Lys, his
losses had been enormous. The 19th Division came
into the line on the 29th May, when prospects were
very gloomy, and their presence did much to establish
a new line. On 6th June the 4th Shropshire,
T.F., of the 19th Division gained the Croix de Guerre,
with palms for the recapture of Mont Bligny.</p>

<p>A well-founded claim might be put forward that
history records no instance where a large body of
troops has come through, without loss of morale
or fighting spirit, three such ordeals, within less
than three months, as were endured by the divisions
composing the British IX. Corps on the Aisne.
Although one of them, the 8th, had not been on
the Lys, it had very heavy fighting about Villers
Bretonneux, which it assisted to recapture 24th/25th
April, three weeks after the close of the March battle.
The other divisions were in all three struggles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Whereas in old days a battle ended within twelve, or
on exceptional occasions within forty-eight hours of
its commencement, the St. Quentin-Somme battle,
generally known as the March Retreat, raged night
and day without cessation for ten days, that on
the Lys for nearly three weeks, and that on the
Aisne for over a week. The question will probably
be discussed by the military historian or essayist
of the future.</p>

<p>Before the “Advance to Victory” was commenced
the 50th Division had been reconstituted.
The battalions which had been destroyed were replaced
as follows:—149th Brigade: 3rd Royal Fusiliers,
13th Black Watch, 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers;
150th Brigade: 2nd Northumberland Fusiliers, 7th
Wiltshire, 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers; 151st Brigade:
6th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, 1st King’s
Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, 4th King’s Royal
Rifle Corps. See <cite>Story of the Fourth Army</cite> (Hodder and
Stoughton), p. 322.</p>

<p>The 50th was again to do fine work, the tradition
held.</p>

<p>As part of the XIII. Corps, Fourth Army, the
Division was employed in the last great British
offensive, and played a part worthy of its past.</p>

<p>In the despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
37, Sir Douglas Haig said: “On the 3rd
October the Fourth Army attacked between Sequehart
and Le Catelet and captured those villages
and Ramicourt (see 46th Division) together with the
Beaurevoir-Fonsomme line on that front. In this
operation the 50th Division took Gouy and Le Catelet
after heavy and prolonged fighting, in which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
number of counter-attacks were beaten off.” This
is now the “Battle of the Beaurevoir Line,” 3rd-5th
October, 1918.</p>

<p>The XIII. Corps was again employed in the
“Battle of Cambrai, 1918,” on 8th and 9th October,
and the 50th was engaged.</p>

<p>Paragraph 46 shows that the XIII. Corps employed
the 50th and 66th Divisions in the successful
“Battle for the Selle Crossings” 17th to 25th October.
See also under 66th Division.</p>

<p>Paragraph 50, “The Battle of the Sambre,” 1st
to 11th November, states that the XIII. Corps was
again engaged. On the 4th at 6.15 a.m. the Corps
“attacked with the 25th, 50th and 18th Divisions
and quickly overran the enemy positions despite
strong opposition which at Preux-au-Bois was maintained
until the village was completely surrounded
by our infantry and tanks.”</p>

<p>Major-General Montgomery in his <cite>Story of the
Fourth Army</cite> deals with the fine work of the 50th
on 3rd October, at p. 182, and as to another attack
by the Division and other troops on the 8th, which
was “an unqualified success,” at p. 196.</p>

<p>On the 4th-5th November, the “Battle of the
Sambre,” the 50th had, in the clearing of the
southern portion of the Mormal Forest, a very
arduous task. It was difficult for the artillery to
give adequate support owing to their movement
being hampered by tree stumps and bogs.</p>

<p>After the 5th, the Division continued to advance.
On the 7th, the Division captured Dourlers and on
the 8th took Semousies and Floursies. On both days
there was obstinate fighting. Regarding the 8th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Major-General Montgomery says, p. 259: “that
the enemy selected the line of the Avesnes-Maubeuge
road as a rearguard position. The vigour and
determination of the attack, however, overcame
all resistance.” When the Armistice came on the
11th, the Division was east of the Avesnes-Maubeuge
road.</p>

<p>The 50th was along with the 25th and other
divisions in the IX. Corps on the Aisne, May 1918,
and again were with the 25th in the XIII. Corps
in the “Advance to Victory.” There is much of
interest regarding the work of both divisions in
these operations in the excellent <cite>History of the 25th</cite>,
by Colonel Kincaid-Smith (Harrison).</p>

<p>Apart from the first eight Regular divisions no
British division had a longer spell of fighting than
the 50th had, was in more of the big battles or came
out of these with a better record.</p>

<p>The 1/9th Durham Light Infantry served with
the 62nd Division in 1918 as Pioneers, but like other
pioneer battalions, had frequently to use their
weapons as well as their tools. The battalion was
chosen for the Army of the Rhine, as was also the
1/5th Border Regiment which was originally “Army
troops,” but replaced the 1/7th Durham Light
Infantry, taken out of the 50th to be a pioneer
battalion.</p>

<p>Northumbria raised an enormous number of units
in the earlier years of the war, and the second line
Territorial Division was, like several others,
sacrificed for draft-finding purposes. A number
of garrison battalions, however, were formed and
went abroad; of these there were selected for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Armies of Occupation, etc.: Western Front, the
2/6th Durham Light Infantry; the Near East, the
2/5th and 2/9th Durham Light Infantry; Egypt,
the 2/7th Northumberland Fusiliers; North Russia,
the 2/7th Durham Light Infantry; Bermuda, the
2/4th East Yorkshire Regiment.</p>

<span class="smcap">First Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Division left Britain at the end of April and
beginning of May 1915, and on arrival in France
was immediately sent to the neighbourhood of the
firing line.</p>

<p>Early in the year the Division had been bereft
of six individual battalions for immediate service
in France with regular divisions. The battalions
which went out separately were replaced by a
brigade of the 55th, West Lancashire, Division,
which remained with the 51st till January 1916,
and by the 6th and 7th Black Watch, battalions
raised in the Highland divisional area but which,
prior to 1914, were Army Troops. The two latter
battalions remained permanently in the 51st
Division.</p>

<p>The 8th Royal Scots, which sailed on 4th November,
1914, joined the 7th Division with which they
took part in the stiff battles of Neuve Chapelle,
10th, 11th and 12th March, 1915, and Festubert,
15th to 18th May, 1915. For their good work on
these and prior occasions six officers and four men
were mentioned in the despatch of 31st May, 1915.
The battalion, in August 1915, joined the 51st
Division as pioneers. In the same despatch officers
and men of the 4th Seaforths, 4th and 6th Gordon
Highlanders and 4th Camerons were mentioned.
The last-named belonged to the Division but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
unfortunately did not serve with it except for about
a month in the beginning of 1916.</p>

<p>The despatch of 15th June, 1915 (as to the Second
Battle of Ypres, now “The Battles of Ypres, 1915,”
which commenced with the great gas attack on 22nd
April and lasted till 25th May), paragraph 4, shows
that the 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders
and 1st East Lancashire Regiment (10th Brigade)
made a successful counter-attack on 8th May; for
their good work two officers and three N.C.O.’s and
men of the Argylls were mentioned. On the 10th
the 9th Royal Scots, afterwards in the 51st, with
other troops, repulsed with heavy loss to the enemy
an attack made under cover of gas. On the 11th
“the Germans attacked in force and gained a
footing in part of the trenches, but were promptly
ejected by a supporting company of the 9th Royal
Scots.” Unofficial writers have paid tribute to the
splendid fighting spirit of these two battalions, the
7th Argylls and 9th Royal Scots, but the price had
to be paid. Sir A. Conan Doyle remarks that on
24th May, 1915, towards the close of the battle,
of the 7th Argylls there remained only two officers
and 76 other ranks.</p>

<p>On 24th May at 2.45 a.m. the 9th Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders and other troops were
“overcome with gas,” and pressed back, “in a
most determined attack.”</p>

<p>In the same despatch, paragraph 5, as to the advance
near Neuve Chapelle and Festubert, Sir John
French remarked that on 17th May he gave orders
“for the 51st (Highland) Division to move into the
neighbourhood of Estaires to be ready to support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the operations of the First Army,” and that on the
19th the 2nd Division was relieved by the 51st
Division. On the 22nd the Division was “attached
to the Indian Corps.” Between the 18th May and
the beginning of June the Division worked hard at
consolidating the ground recently gained.</p>

<p>On 15th June the 51st along with the Canadians
and 7th Division took part in an attack near
Givenchy which met with little success. The
casualties of the Division could not be called slight.</p>

<p>In July 1915 the Division was ordered to join the
X. Corps, Third Army, and on the last days of the
month took over from a French Division a section
about Hamel near the Ancre.</p>

<p>About this time the Division seems to have gained
the confidence of G.H.Q., as in August and later
various New Army Divisions were attached to it
for instruction, including the 18th, 22nd, 32nd, etc.</p>

<p>In January 1916 the Lancashire Brigade left to
join their own Division and the 51st received the
9th Royal Scots, 4th Seaforths, 4th Gordon Highlanders
and 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 23rd December,
1916, which deals with the Somme Battle,
paragraph 17 (Dent’s edition), mentioned various
engagements, now called the “Battle of Bazentin
Ridge,” in the latter half of July. “That evening
(24th July) after heavy artillery preparation, the
enemy launched two more powerful counter-attacks,
the one directed against our new position in and
around High Wood (51st Division, Major-General
G. M. Harper) and the other delivered from the
north-west of Delville Wood. Both attacks were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
completely broken up with very heavy losses to
the enemy.” The Division had attacked on the
22nd-23rd but had failed to gain much ground.</p>

<p>Paragraph 19 and note: Early in August the 51st,
along with other divisions, was in other operations
“involving much fierce and obstinate fighting,” by
which the line was pushed forward. About the
7th of August the Division was relieved and taken
to Armentières. In the beginning of October the
Division again went south, at first to Hebuterne
and on the 17th to Beaumont Hamel.</p>

<p>Paragraph 33 and note, also 35 and 36 of the
despatch, show that the 51st along with other troops
took part in the attack on the Beaumont Hamel-St.
Pierre Divion position on 13th November, now
the “Battle of the Ancre, 1916.” In a note to paragraph
33 it is remarked: “As the season advanced
and the bad weather continued the scope of our
plan had constantly to be reduced, until finally it
was only possible to undertake the much more
limited operation of the 13th November against
Beaumont Hamel. The brilliant success of this attack,
carried out as it was under most difficult conditions
of ground, affords some indication of what
might have been accomplished had the weather permitted
us to give fuller effect to our original plan.”
The 51st Division captured the village, which was
very strongly fortified, and over 2000 prisoners, their
own losses being about 2500.</p>

<p>The “brilliant success” of the Division in the
Beaumont Hamel battle brought it fame which
was to endure and increase as the years of the
war rolled on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>During December 1916, and part of January 1917,
the Division was in the Courcelette sector where
things were far from peaceful and hardships were
extreme. In February they moved north to Arras,
and remained there till the Battle of Arras.</p>

<p>The despatch of 25th December, 1917, paragraphs
13 and 14, and note to paragraph 13 (Dent’s edition),
describes the opening stages of the Battles of
Arras which began on 9th April, 1917. The 51st,
then in the XVII. Corps, Third Army, attacked east
of Roclincourt, north-east of Arras; they were near
the left of the line and next the Canadians whose
task it was to seize the main Vimy Ridge. The 51st
and its neighbour on the right, the 34th, had heavy
fighting. “Their advance was delayed, not checked.”
The whole attack on the 9th was a great success.
The fighting between the 9th and 14th is now the
First Battle of the Scarpe, 1917. On the 12th the
Division left the line, re-entering it on the 15th-16th
and remaining in the battle till the 24th-25th.</p>

<p>Paragraph 21 deals with a big attack which our
troops made on 23rd April on a front of nine miles,
the Second Battle of the Scarpe, 1917. “North
of the Scarpe Highland Territorials (51st Division)
were engaged in heavy fighting on the western outskirts
of Rœux Wood and the chemical works.”
“During the afternoon many counter-attacks developed
all along the line and were repeated by the
enemy with the utmost determination regardless of
the heavy losses inflicted by our fire.” “North of
the Scarpe fierce fighting continued for the possession
of Rœux, the chemical works and the station
to the north without producing any lasting change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
in the situation.” The attack was renewed on the
24th and more progress was then made, the enemy’s
resistance weakening. For their “splendid” work
on the 23rd, the Division was thanked and congratulated
by the Corps and Army Commanders.</p>

<p>The losses of the Division during April amounted
to about 4500.</p>

<p>Paragraph 27, as to the fighting in May, Third
Battle of the Scarpe, 1917: “On the night of
the 13th-14th our troops (51st Division) captured
Rœux.” The Division drove back some very heavy
counter-attacks. Fighting continued for some days.
The Army Commander again wired to the Division
his congratulations “on their great gallantry at
Rœux and the chemical works.”</p>

<p>The Division was relieved on the 31st May, and
a few days later was taken to the Ypres sector,
there to refit and prepare for another great battle.</p>

<p>Paragraph 41 of the despatch deals with the assault
by the British troops on 31st July, 1917, the
“Battle of Pilckem Ridge” at the beginning of
the Third Battle of Ypres. The note in Messrs.
Dent’s edition, p. 113, gives a list of the divisions
employed. Among these is the 51st, then in the
XVIII. Corps, Fifth Army. They were near the left
of the British line. “Highland Territorials (51st
Division) Welsh and Guards battalions secured the
crossings of the Steenbeek.” All objectives were
taken early in the day. The losses of the Division
were about 1600 and they took about 650 prisoners.</p>

<p>Paragraph 50 describes a successful attack made
on 20th September: “North of the Zonnebeke-Langemarck
Road, London and Highland Territorials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
(58th and 51st Divisions) gained the whole
of their objectives by midday though stiff fighting
took place for a number of farms and strong
places.”</p>

<p>This action is now the Battle of the Menin Road
Ridge. The losses of the Division were 1150.</p>

<p>The Division received the congratulations of the
Corps and Army commanders on their work in the
Ypres battles. In his message the Corps Commander
said: “I venture to place it among the three best
fighting divisions I have met in France during the
past three years.”</p>

<p>About this time the enemy published a statement
that the 51st was the “most formidable division
on the Western Front.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of October the Division was back
in the area south-east of Arras.</p>

<p>The despatch of 20th February, 1918, paragraph
3, shows that the 51st Division was part of the attacking
force at the Battle of Cambrai, 1917, which
commenced on 20th November, 1917. After mentioning
the capture of Ribecourt by the 6th Division
and the storming of Havrincourt by the 62nd, Sir
Douglas Haig said: “The capture of these two
villages secured the flanks of the 51st (Highland)
Division (T.), Major-General G. M. Harper, advancing
on the left centre of our attack up the slopes
of Flesquières Hill against the German trench lines
on the southern side of Flesquières village. Here
very heavy fighting took place. The stout brick
wall skirting the Château grounds opposed a
formidable obstacle to our advance, while German
machine guns swept the approaches. A number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
of tanks were knocked out by direct hits from
German field batteries in position beyond the crest
of the hill. None the less, with the exception of
the village itself, our second objectives in this area
were gained before midday.” Paragraph 4: “On
the morning of the 21st November, the attack on
Flesquières was resumed, and by 8 a.m. the village
had been turned from the north-west and captured.”
“Following upon the capture of Flesquières,
the 51st and 62nd Divisions, in co-operation with a
number of tanks and squadrons of the 1st Cavalry
Division, attacked at 10.30 a.m. in the direction of
Fontaine-Notre-Dame and Bourlon. In this attack
the capture of Anneux was completed, and, early
in the afternoon, Cantaing was seized with some
hundreds of prisoners. Progress was made on the
outskirts of Bourlon Wood and, late in the afternoon,
Fontaine-Notre-Dame was taken by the
troops of the 51st Division and tanks.”</p>

<p>The last-mentioned village was lost on the
following day, see paragraph 6.</p>

<p>Paragraph 7: “On the morning of the 23rd
November the 51st Division, supported by tanks,
attacked Fontaine-Notre-Dame, but was unable
to force an entrance. Early in the afternoon this
Division repeated its attack from the west, and a
number of tanks entered Fontaine, where they remained
till dusk, inflicting considerable loss on the
enemy. We did not succeed, however, in clearing
the village, and at the end of the day no progress
had been made on this part of our front.”</p>

<p>On the 27th the Guards Division, which had
relieved the 51st, again entered the much fought-for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
village, but it was partly commanded by the
Bourlon ridge and could not be held.</p>

<p>The 51st were not in the line on the 30th when
the German counter-offensive took place. See 47th,
55th and 56th Divisions.</p>

<p>In the Cambrai battle the casualties of the Division
were 1570. They took 2690 unwounded prisoners.</p>

<p>The great German offensive of March 1918 is
dealt with in the despatch of 20th July, 1918. The
51st Division were then in the IV. Corps, Third
Army, and were holding front line positions near
Hermies, west of the Flesquières salient. On their
right was the 17th Division of the V. Corps and on
their left, about Lagnicourt, the 6th Division of
the IV. Corps; see map opposite p. 186 of Messrs.
Dent’s edition of the <cite>Despatches</cite>.</p>

<p>In paragraph 16 Sir Douglas Haig, dealing with
the 21st March, said: “On the Third Army front our
line in the Flesquières salient had not been heavily
attacked and was substantially intact. Beyond this
sector fierce fighting took place around Demicourt
and Doignies, and north of the village of Baumetz-lez-Cambrai.
In this area the 51st Division, under
the command of Major-General G. T. C. Carter-Campbell,
was heavily engaged, but from noon
onwards practically no progress was made by the
enemy.”</p>

<p>In his telegraphic despatch of 22nd March, after
referring to the exceptional gallantry of the 24th
and 3rd Divisions, Sir Douglas Haig said: “A very
gallant fight was made by the 51st Division also,
in the neighbourhood of the Bapaume-Cambrai
road, against repeated attacks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>In paragraph 21 of the written despatch, dealing
with the 22nd March, Sir Douglas Haig said: “In
the neighbourhood of Baumetz the enemy continued
his assaults with great determination, but was held
by the 51st Division and a brigade of the 25th
Division until the evening. Our troops were then
withdrawn, under orders, to positions south of the
village.”</p>

<p>The fighting between 21st and 23rd March is now
the Battle of St. Quentin, and that on 24th-25th
March, the First Battle of Bapaume.</p>

<p>During the next few days the 51st Division fought
many critical rearguard actions. It was thereafter
taken out of the line. Its total losses since the
morning of the 21st were over 4900.</p>

<p>About 1st April the Division entrained for the
Béthune area and it was hoped that things would be
quieter there; that hope was quickly to be blasted.</p>

<p>The same despatch deals with the German offensive
in Flanders which commenced on 9th April.
See also 49th, 50th, 55th and 61st Divisions.</p>

<p>Paragraph 51 deals with the opening of the Lys
battle on 9th April. It is there stated: “Meanwhile,
shortly after the opening of the bombardment, orders
had been given to the 51st and 50th Divisions to
move up behind Richebourg-St.-Vaast and Laventie
and take up their positions in accordance with the
pre-arranged defence scheme. Both these divisions
had also been heavily engaged in the Somme battle,
and had but recently arrived in the neighbourhood.”
In the course of the forenoon, when the left of the
55th Division had to move back to form a defensive
flank, touch was established with the 51st. The 1st<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
King Edwards Horse and 11th Cyclist Battalion
who had covered the deployment of the 51st and
50th occupied Lacouture, etc.,” and “by their
splendid defence of these places enabled troops of
the 51st and 50th Divisions to come into action
east of the Lawe river between Le Touret and
Estaires.” A quotation as to the heavy fighting
which took place during the afternoon of the 9th
has already been given under the 50th, and some
remarks by Sir Douglas Haig as to the splendid
bearing of the divisions in the Lys battle have been
given under the 49th.</p>

<p>In his telegraphic despatch of 11th April, Sir
Douglas Haig said that “the 51st Division had
beaten off incessant attacks with great loss to the
enemy and, by vigorous and successful counter-attacks
had recaptured positions into which the
enemy had forced his way.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 58 of the written despatch shows that
by a sudden attack just before dawn on April 12th
the enemy broke through the left centre of the 51st
Division about Pacaut and Diez du Vinage, but
with the arrival of reinforcements “the enemy’s
progress in this sector of the front was definitely
checked.”</p>

<p>The Division had over 2500 casualties in the
Lys battles. In a congratulatory message to the
Division, dated 16th April, the First Army Commander
said, “You have done wonders.”</p>

<p>About the beginning of May the Division moved
to the area east of Arras and remained about Oppy
till 11th July. Here they had a comparatively
quiet time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraphs
11 and 12, deals with the assistance afforded by the
British to their Allies in the Second Battle of the
Marne. It shows that the XXII. Corps, Lieut.-General
Sir A. Godley, comprising the 15th, 34th,
51st and 62nd Divisions, were sent south in July.
The two latter went to the east side of the salient.
Paragraph 12 says: “On the 20th July, the 51st
and 62nd Divisions of the XXII. Corps, attacked in
conjunction with the French on the eastern side of
the salient, south-west of Reims. The sector assigned
to the British troops covered a front of 8000 yards,
astride the Ardre river, and consisted of an open
valley bottom, with steep wooded slopes on either
side. Both valley and slopes were studded with
villages and hamlets, which were for the most part
intact, and afforded excellent cover for the enemy.
On this front our troops were engaged for a period
of ten days in continuous fighting of a most difficult
and trying nature. Throughout this period steady
progress was made, in the face of vigorous and
determined resistance. Marfaux was taken on the
23rd July and on the 28th British troops retook the
Montagne de Bligny which other British troops had
defended with so much gallantry and success two
months previously. In these operations, throughout
which French artillery and tanks rendered invaluable
assistance, the 51st and 62nd Divisions took
1200 prisoners from seven different German divisions
and successfully completed an advance of over
four miles.” This is now designated the “Battle of
Tardenois.”</p>

<p>General Berthelot, commanding the Fifth French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Army, issued on 1st August an eloquent Order of
the Day as to the work of the two divisions, in
which the British had made the Valley of the Ardre
their own, “bountifully watered with their blood.”
He mentioned that in addition to the prisoners
140 machine guns and 40 guns had been captured.
“You, one and all, have added a glorious page to
your history. Marfaux, Chaumuzy and the Montagne
Bligny, these splendid words will be written
in letters of gold in the annals of your regiments.
Your French friends will remember your marvellous
bravery and your perfect comradeship in arms.”
Later, General Guillaumat, then commanding the
Fifth Army, bestowed on the 6th Battalion, Black
Watch, Royal Highlanders (Perthshire), the exceptionally
high honour of being “cité à l’Ordre de
l’Armée” as follows:—</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The 6th Battalion Royal Highlanders</span></p>

<p>“This battalion <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’élite</i>, under the forceful command
of Lieutenant Colonel Francis Rowland
Tarleton, has given proof of splendid spirit and dash
in the course of the hard fought battles between
July 20th and 30th, 1918. After seven days of
bloody fighting, in spite of exhaustion and the
heavy losses caused by intense enemy machine-gun
fire, it successfully stormed a wood strongly fortified
and stubbornly defended by the enemy.”</p>

<p>The losses of the 51st in July amounted to about
3900.</p>

<p>Both divisions were brought north to take part
in the last British offensive commencing in August.
In the supplementary despatch of 13th September,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
1918, as to the work of certain divisions, Sir Douglas
Haig said: “The 51st Division after taking part
in both the Somme and Lys battles of March and
April, and also in the French offensive south-west
of Reims, on August 26th attacked north of the
Scarpe, and in five days of successful fighting captured
Rœux, Greenland Hill and Plouvain.” The
despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph 27,
deals with the Battle of the Scarpe, 26th August
to 3rd September, and shows that at that time the
51st was serving in General Sir Henry Horne’s
First Army, along with the Canadian Corps,
who fought on their right. The incidents above-mentioned
are again dealt with.</p>

<p>The Division’s losses in the Greenland Hill
operations amounted to 1145. For their fine work
they were congratulated and thanked by the Commander
of the Canadian Corps, under whose orders
they were in the Scarpe battle.</p>

<p>About the end of August and beginning of
September the XXII. Corps took over on the north
and south sides of the Scarpe and the 51st Division
became part of that Corps. In the beginning of
October the Corps moved to the south of the
Canadian Corps and took part in what is now the
“Battle of Cambrai, 1918,” 8th-9th October, with
pursuit to the Selle, 9th-12th October, and on
11th October an advance towards the Selle river
was commenced. On the 12th and 13th, the 51st
had hard fighting. The attack was renewed on the
19th when there were signs of the enemy retiring,
and he was closely pressed. The 51st took a prominent
part, until the 29th of October, in various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
actions which involved bitter fighting. For a most
gallant charge against a counter-attack by the
enemy, the 6th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,
who had rejoined the 51st in October after two
years’ service as Pioneers to the 5th Division, were
complimented by the Corps Commander.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 46 and 47 of the despatch deal with
the Battle of the Selle River, 17th-25th October,
and show that the 51st, as part of the XXII. Corps,
First Army, were on the left of the attack on 24th
October. The telegraphic despatches stated that
the Division had sharp fighting on the 24th and
again on the 27th when they repulsed a determined
counter-attack near Maing with the bayonet. Their
losses during October were 2835.</p>

<p>At the end of October the Division went out of
the line to rest, and its very distinguished fighting
career was closed.</p>

<p>Scottish regiments were, at various times during
the war, in debt to the Midlands of England for
drafts of young soldiers, who soon got the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i> of their Scottish units. This debt was, partly
at least, repaid when brigades were cut down to
three battalions in the beginning of 1918. At that
time the 51st gave to the 61st (South Midland)
Division, three of its best battalions, the 9th Royal
Scots, 5th Gordons, and 8th Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders. These formed the 183rd Brigade;
and, in his detailed description of the awful
struggle during the March Retreat, Battle of St.
Quentin, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gives the greatest
possible credit to this brigade. The whole Division
did splendid work in the St. Quentin battle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and also in the Lys battles in April. See 61st
Division.</p>

<p>After the close of the Lys battles these three
battalions were taken from the 61st and, at Arras,
joined the 15th, Scottish, New Army, Division,
which at Loos had earned a reputation it never lost.
In July the 15th, as part of the XXII. Corps, went
to the south-west of Soissons, in the French area,
and came under the command of General Mangin
for the great counter-attack on the German salient,
which began on 18th July—the turning-point or day
of the War. All three battalions played a notable
part in the Buzancy battle on 28th July and following
days, and paid their full share of the price
for the great distinction earned by the 15th Division
on that occasion. No higher compliment could have
been paid by an Ally than the erection, by the French
17th Division, of the monument at Buzancy to the
fallen of the 15th Division. See paragraph 12 of
the despatch of 21st December, 1918, and note in
Messrs. Dent’s edition.</p>

<p>After Buzancy the 15th was taken to the Flanders
border; its last great fight was past.</p>

<p>The following units of the 51st Division were
chosen for the Armies of Occupation: 1/6th Black
Watch, 1/4th and 1/5th Gordon Highlanders, and
1/8th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="52ND_LOWLAND_DIVISION"><span class="allsmcap">52ND</span> (LOWLAND) DIVISION<br>
<span class="smcap">First Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">After a long service on coast defence work in
Scotland, the Division, in the last half of May,
1915, sailed for the Mediterranean and arrived at
Alexandria early in June. Considerable intervals
separated the dates of despatch of the various
battalions to the Dardanelles, but the Division had
practically all landed there before the first week of
July closed.</p>

<p>The 156th Brigade, which disembarked 13th-16th
June, was in time to take part in the action
of 28th June. The Brigade was attached to the 29th
Division and came into action on the right of the
87th Brigade.</p>

<p>The main object of the attack was to give the
British more elbow room, our situation being still
exceedingly cramped.</p>

<p>Sir Ian Hamilton, in his despatch of 26th August,
1915, states that the assault was entrusted to the
VIII. Corps, Lieut.-General A. G. Hunter-Weston.
The 29th Division on the left had to carry the
greatest extent of ground. “On the right of the
87th Brigade the 4th and 7th Royal Scots captured
the further two Turkish trenches allotted to them,
but further to the east, near the pivotal point, the
remainder of the 156th Brigade was unable to get
on.” The ground gained was held against “repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
counter-attacks, which for many days and nights
afterwards the enemy launched against the trenches
they had lost.”</p>

<p>The enemy trenches opposite the right front of
the attack, near the pivotal point, had not been
seriously bombarded by the artillery owing to
shortage of shells. At that time a preliminary
bombardment was a mere pretence when contrasted
with what it became in 1917 or 1918, while the
creeping barrage had not yet been devised. The
8th Battalion Scottish Rifles, the right battalion of
the 156th Brigade, supported by the 7th Battalion,
found themselves, as soon as they were “over the
top,” subjected to a murderous enfilade machine-gun
fire from the right flank. Only a few unwounded
men reached the opposing trenches, which were 175
yards distant. The 8th Battalion went in about 650
strong, they came out with one officer and 29 other
ranks. One man who had reached the enemy position
was captured. The ordeal of the battalion, in
this its first action, seems to have been as severe
as any experienced by an infantry battalion during
the war.</p>

<p>The Turkish position at this point, H. 12, was
attacked by another brigade soon afterwards. It
remained intact, although the attackers suffered a
loss of 1700.</p>

<p>In Sir Ian Hamilton’s despatch of 11th December,
1915, he described the battle at Helles on 12th-13th
July, and the Suvla Bay fighting in August. The
action of 12th-13th July was supplementary to
that of 28th June, the object being to push back
the Turkish centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“On our right the attack was to be entrusted to
the French Corps; on the right centre to the 52nd
(Lowland) Division. On the 52nd Division’s front
the operation was planned to take place in two
phases; our right was to attack in the morning,
our left in the afternoon.” The 29th Division was
to make a diversion on the left. “At 7.35 a.m. after
a heavy bombardment, the troops, French and
Scottish, dashed out of their trenches, and at once
captured two lines of enemy trenches.” The 1st
Division of the French Corps pushed forward and
carried the whole forward system. “Further to
the left the 2nd French Division and our 155th
Brigade maintained the two lines of trenches they
had gained. But on the left of the 155th Brigade
the 4th Battalion King’s Own Scottish Borderers
pressed on too eagerly. They not only carried the
third line of trenches, but charged on up the hill
and beyond the third line, then advanced indeed
until they came under the ‘feu-de-barrage’ of the
French Artillery. Nothing could live under so
cruel a cross fire from friend and foe, so the King’s
Own Scottish Borderers were forced to fall back
with heavy losses to the second line of enemy
trenches which they had captured in the first rush.”</p>

<p>The second phase of the attack was launched
as planned. “The 157th Brigade rushed forward
under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, and splendidly
carried the whole of the enemy trenches
allotted as their objective. Here then our line had
advanced some 400 yards, while the 155th Brigade
and the 2nd French Division had advanced between
200 and 300 yards. At six p.m. the 52nd Division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
was ordered to make the line good. It seemed to
be fairly within our grasp.”</p>

<p>“All night long determined counter-attacks, one
after another, were repulsed by the French and the
155th Brigade, but about 7.30 a.m. the right of the
157th Brigade gave way before a party of bombers
and our grip upon the enemy began to weaken.”
Another attack at 3 p.m. on the 13th, in which the
Royal Naval Division and French took part, met
with success, and on the whole the line was greatly
improved by the operations of the two days. “A
solid and enduring advance had been achieved.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Sir Ian Hamilton said: “The 1/5th Royal Scots
Fusiliers commanded by Lieut.-Colonel J. B. Pollok
McCall; the 1/7th Royal Scots, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel W. C. Peebles; the 1/5th King’s Own
Scottish Borderers, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
W. J. Millar; and the 1/6th Highland Light Infantry,
commanded by Major J. Anderson, are mentioned
as having specially distinguished themselves
in this engagement.”</p>

<p>In his despatch of 6th March, 1916, which deals
with the evacuation of the Gallipoli Peninsula,
Sir C. C. Monro remarked: “Meanwhile the VIII.
Corps had maintained the offensive spirit in bombing
and minor operations with which they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
established the moral superiority they enjoyed over
the enemy. On the 29th December, the 52nd Division
completed the excellent work which they had
been carrying out for so long by capturing a considerable
portion of the Turkish trenches, and by
successfully holding these in the face of repeated
counter-attacks.”</p>

<p>The commander of the Division, Major-General
the Hon. H. A. Lawrence, “was selected to take
charge of all embarkation operations.” The evacuation
from Helles took place on the night of 8th
January, 1916.</p>

<p>The 52nd Division was taken to Egypt. They
crossed to the east side of the Suez Canal about the
beginning of March, 1916, and they were to spend
the ensuing twelve months in the desert of Sinai,
their energies being consumed in assisting with
railway construction and making and manning
defensive posts.</p>

<p>In Sir A. Murray’s despatch, dated 1st June, 1916,
as to operations of the Egyptian force, between 10th
January and 31st May, 1916, paragraph 8, after
describing the attack on the Yeomanry at Oghratina
and Qatia in the Sinai Peninsula on 23rd April, he
says: “Meanwhile, at 5.30 a.m. a Turkish force,
1000 strong, with one gun, advancing from the south,
attacked Dueidar, the most advanced defensible post,
which was held by 100 men of the 5th Battalion,
Royal Scots Fusiliers, under the command of Captain
Roberts, 5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. This
officer, who throughout showed conspicuous skill and
ability, succeeded in repelling two determined attacks
on the position at 6.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. respectively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
Both attempts cost the enemy dear. At 9.30 a.m.
reinforcements of two companies, 4th Royal Scots
Fusiliers, under the command of Major Thompson,
of that battalion, who had been despatched from
Hill 70, seven miles away, on the first news of the
attack, arrived at Dueidar. The various posts were
strengthened and a counter-attack, delivered at
12.30 p.m. with great spirit, forced the enemy to
retire, leaving 30 prisoners in our hands and 70
dead.”</p>

<p>In his despatch of 1st October, 1916, Sir A.
Murray dealt with operations in the desert east
of the canal, in particular with the fighting on
3rd, 4th and 5th August, 1916, an attack by the
Turks, the British counter-attack, etc. Paragraph
5: During the 4th, the enemy made several attacks
against the Romani-Mahemdia defences, from the
east, south and south-west. “These were repulsed
by the garrisons, composed of Scottish and Welsh
infantry, with considerable loss, and in spite of heavy
artillery fire from the enemy’s heavy howitzers, which
in one or two cases inflicted severe casualties on our
troops, who behaved with admirable steadiness.”
“Vigorous action, to the utmost limits of endurance,
was ordered for the next day, and the troops,
in spite of the heat, responded nobly. At daybreak
the Scottish Territorial infantry, assisted by
Australian and New Zealand mounted troops, took
the remainder of Wellington Ridge by assault, capturing
about 1500 prisoners.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 6: “The Scottish troops, commanded
by Major-General W. E. B. Smith, C.M.G., not
only showed great steadiness under heavy artillery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
fire, but were responsible for the assault which
recaptured Wellington Ridge, on 4th August, and
for clearing Abu Hamra on the 5th.”</p>

<p>The troops mainly responsible for the recapture
of the ridge were the 7th and 8th Scottish Rifles.
These moved out from Romani, about two miles
from the Ridge, at dusk on the 4th. The 7th, on the
left, linked up with a work, 22a, garrisoned by the
5th Royal Scots Fusiliers. The 8th under Colonel
Findlay pressed up the hill, and when the leading
lines were about 50 yards from the crest they were
fired on; they then dug in. The 7th moved forward
until in line with the 8th. At dawn mounted troops
came up on the right and about the same time a
company of the 5th Royal Scots Fusiliers arrived.
An assault had been ordered when the Turks surrendered.
The 8th Scottish Rifles took 360 prisoners
and the mounted troops prevented the remainder
from escaping.</p>

<p>The fighting 4th-5th August is now designated
the “Battle of Rumani.”</p>

<p>The Division was in reserve in the first Battle
of Gaza on 26th March, 1917 (see 53rd Division),
but had stiff fighting in the second attempt made
by Sir A. Murray’s force to capture Gaza on 17th-19th
April, 1917.</p>

<p>The despatch of 28th June, 1917, paragraph 9,
shows that on 17th April the 52nd Division was
in the centre, the 53rd on the left and the 54th
on the right. The Abbas-Mansura ridge was seized
by the 157th Brigade of the 52nd Division, with
little opposition, and preparation was made for a
further advance on the 19th. The arrangement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
the divisions was as on the 17th. The 52nd in the
centre unfortunately found its task too heavy.</p>

<p>“The left brigade of the 52nd Division” (the only
one, as stated in paragraph 10, which could with
advantage be employed owing to the configuration
of the ground) “made good Lees Hill, the nearest
point to our line of the enemy defences on the Ali
Muntar ridge by 8.15 a.m., but on advancing beyond
the Lees Hill this brigade came under very heavy
machine-gun fire from Outpost Hill, which checked
its progress.” At 10 a.m. a lunette on Outpost
Hill was captured.</p>

<p>Later “the left brigade, 52nd Division, was shelled
out of its position on Outpost Hill, but the position
was most gallantly retaken on his own initiative
by Major W. T. Forrest, M.C., K.O.S.B., subsequently
killed, who collected a few men for the
purpose. All further attempts to launch an attack
from Outpost Hill were shattered by fire at their
inception.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 10: In the afternoon the position was
that the 52nd could not advance. A large area
of extremely broken ground had been made exceedingly
strong by the enemy, and the nests of
machine guns could not be located and destroyed.
The attack was eventually abandoned, the British
losses being about 7000 men, but all ground gained
was consolidated and kept. The “left brigade” was
the 155th, the 156th was on the right and the 157th
in reserve. The capture of the objectives involved
an advance of two miles, with little cover, and only
moderate artillery support.</p>

<p>At paragraph 15 Sir A. Murray recorded his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
appreciation of what his troops had done. “Particular
commendation is due to the infantry—52nd,
53rd and 54th Divisions.” “Under severe trial they
have now given ample proof of the finest soldierly
qualities.”</p>

<p>Sir E. Allenby took over the command of the
Egyptian Expeditionary Force on 28th June, 1917.
In his despatch of 16th December, 1917, he recounts
the progress of the operations which culminated
in the surrender of Jerusalem. The Army had
received increases of strength and this enabled
the commander to deal with a wider front and to
avoid a direct attack on Gaza. Beersheba at the
other end of the line was taken on 31st October.
The Lowland Division was second from the left of
the British line, opposite Gaza.</p>

<p>The despatch, paragraph 9, states: “As Umbrella
Hill flanked the advance against the Turkish
works further west, it was decided to capture it by
a preliminary operation, to take place four hours
previous to the main attack. It was accordingly
attacked and captured at 11 p.m. on November
1st, by a portion of the 52nd (Lowland) Division.
This attack drew a heavy bombardment of Umbrella
Hill itself and our front lines, which lasted for two
hours, but ceased in time to allow the main attack,
which was timed for 3 a.m., to form up without
interference.”</p>

<p>The 7th Scottish Rifles had the principal rôle
in the capture of Umbrella Hill.</p>

<p>In the main attack almost all objectives were
reached. Between the 1st and the 6th progress was
made east of Gaza and on the 7th it was found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the fortress had been evacuated. The fighting 27th
October-7th November is now the “Third Battle of
Gaza.”</p>

<p>The British at once pursued, the 52nd Division
following the coast. In paragraph 15, Sir E. Allenby
speaks “of the rapidity of our movement along the
coast and the determination with which his rearguards
on this flank had been pressed.”</p>

<p>“The advanced guard of the 52nd (Lowland)
Division had forced its way almost to Burkah on
the 11th.”</p>

<p>After describing the position taken up by the
Turks the despatch states that an attack for the
13th November was arranged. “This Katrah-El-Mughar
line forms a very strong position, and it
was here that the enemy made his most determined
resistance against the turning movement directed
against his right flank. The capture of this position
by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, assisted by a most
dashing charge of mounted troops, who galloped
across the plain under heavy fire and turned the
enemy’s position from the north, was a fine feat
of arms. Some 1100 prisoners, 3 guns and many
machine guns were taken here. After this the enemy
resistance weakened, and by the evening his forces
were retiring east and north.”</p>

<p>“In fifteen days our force had advanced sixty
miles on its right, and about forty on its left. It
had driven a Turkish army of nine infantry divisions
and one cavalry division out of a position in
which it had been entrenched for six months, and
had pursued it, giving battle whenever it attempted
to stand, and inflicting on it losses amounting probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
to nearly two-thirds of the enemy’s original
effectives. Over 9000 prisoners, about 80 guns, more
than 100 machine guns, and very large quantities of
ammunition and other stores had been captured.”</p>

<p>It is pardonable to point out here that the
infantry of Sir E. Allenby’s army was up till April
1918 composed, to the extent of four-fifths, of
Territorial Divisions.</p>

<p>Jaffa was occupied on 16th November, 1917.</p>

<p>The despatch, paragraph 17, states that the “52nd
Division in nine days covered 69 miles.” Much of this
was over heavy sand or very poor tracks.</p>

<p>Paragraph 20 refers to various attacks by the
Turks: there was “particularly heavy fighting”
towards the close of November near El Burj, “but
Yeomanry and Scottish troops successfully resisted
all attacks and inflicted severe losses on the enemy.”
A large number of prisoners were taken. Officially
the fighting, 17th-24th November, is now the
“Battle of Nebi Samwil.”</p>

<p>Jerusalem was surrendered to troops of the 53rd
and 60th Divisions on 9th December. See also
53rd, 54th and 60th Divisions.</p>

<p>In his despatch of 18th September, 1918, Sir E.
Allenby stated that his next operations were designed
to increase the security of Jaffa and Jerusalem. To
the XXI. Corps, 52nd and 54th Divisions, was assigned
the task of increasing the distance, between
Jaffa and the enemy, from three miles to eight miles.</p>

<p>Paragraph 3: “The weather was unfavourable.
Heavy rains made the roads deep in mud and brought
down the streams.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 4: “The chief obstacle lay in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
crossing of the Nahr El Auja. This river is only
fordable in places and all approaches to it are overlooked
from Sheikh Muannis and Khurbet Hadrah.
At these places two spurs running from north to
south terminate abruptly in steep slopes some 500
yards from the river.” These two places “and the
high ground overlooking the river had to be captured,
as a preliminary to the general advance, in
order that bridges might be built.</p>

<p>“The chief difficulty lay in concealing the collection
and preparation of rafts and bridging material.
All preparations were completed, however, without
attracting the enemy’s attention, and on the night
of December 20th-21st, the 52nd Division crossed
the river in three columns. The enemy was taken
completely by surprise. The left column, fording
the river near its mouth, at this point four feet
deep, captured Tell Er Rekkeit, 4000 yards north
of the river’s mouth; the centre and right columns
crossing on rafts, rushed Sheikh Muannis and Khurbet
Hadrah at the point of the bayonet. By dawn
a line from Khurbet Hadrah to Tell Er Rekkeit
had been consolidated, and the enemy deprived of
all observation from the north over the valley of
the Nahr El Auja.</p>

<p>“The successful crossing of the Nahr El Auja
reflects great credit on the 52nd (Lowland) Division.
It involved considerable preparation, the details
of which were thought out with care and precision.
The sodden state of the ground and, on
the night of the crossing, the swollen state of the
river added to the difficulties, yet by dawn the
whole of the infantry had crossed. The fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the enemy were taken by surprise, and that all
resistance was overcome with the bayonet without
a shot being fired, bears testimony to the discipline
of this Division. Eleven officers, including two battalion
commanders, and 305 other ranks, and ten
machine guns were captured in this operation.”</p>

<p>Despite “considerable hostile shell fire” bridges
were completed, and by dusk on the 21st the whole
of the Divisional artillery had crossed. On the 22nd,
the 54th captured certain villages, and the 52nd
not only reached all their objectives but consolidated
a line two miles beyond “to deny direct
observation on Jaffa harbour to the enemy.”</p>

<p>For their particularly fine work the 52nd received
the congratulations of the Army, Corps and Divisional
commanders. All three brigades shared in
the work and the distinction it brought. The 155th
took Khurbet Hadrah, the 156th Sheikh Muannis,
and the 157th, the brigade which forded the river,
captured Tell Er Rekkeit.</p>

<p>The fighting 21st-22nd December is now designated
the “Battle of Jaffa.”</p>

<p>At the close of the despatch, paragraph 15, Sir
Edmund Allenby remarked that the 52nd Division
embarked for France in the first week of April 1918.
On 7th-8th May the Division took over a portion
of the line east of Arras. They were now in the
VIII. Corps under Commander Sir A. Hunter
Weston, with whom they first fought at the Dardanelles.
In the middle of August they moved further
south to take a part in the big effort to be made
there.</p>

<p>A quotation from Sir Douglas Haig’s telegraphic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
despatch of 13th September, 1918, as to good work
by various divisions, which contains a reference
to the 52nd attacking along with the 56th on
23rd August, is given under the 56th, London,
Division.</p>

<p>In the despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
22, Sir Douglas Haig mentioned that the 52nd was
employed with the VI. Corps, Third Army, in the
main attack on 23rd-24th August, a phase of the
“Battle of Albert, 1918,” in the sector north of
Albert. “On the left of the 56th, the 52nd Division
(Major-General J. Hill) took Hénin-sur-Cojeul and
gained a footing in St.-Martin-sur-Cojeul.”</p>

<p>Heavy fighting on 24th August and following
days brought the 52nd into the Hindenburg line.
On the 26th they made good progress on the north
of the Cojeul and took Hénin Hill, getting well into
the Hindenburg line, and moving down it on the
27th, they gave assistance to the 56th on their right.</p>

<p>The fighting in this area 26th-30th August is
now officially designated the “Battle of the Scarpe,
1918.”</p>

<p>After three days’ rest the 52nd relieved the 56th
and, on 1st September, cleared the famous Bullecourt,
round which there had been a great struggle;
as there was in April 1917. This was a necessary
preliminary to a big attack fixed for the 2nd
September.</p>

<p>Paragraph 28 of the despatch deals with “The
storming of the Drocourt-Quéant line” on 2nd September.
“The maze of trenches at the junction of
that line and the Hindenburg system was stormed
and the enemy was thrown into precipitate retreat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
on the whole front to the south of it. This gallant
feat of arms was carried out by the Canadian Corps
of the First Army,” with “the 4th English Division,
and the XVII. Corps of the Third Army, employing
the 52nd, 57th and 63rd Divisions.”</p>

<p>After referring to the fine work of the Canadian
Corps, Sir Douglas Haig said: “On the right the
attack of the XVII. Corps, launched, at the same
hour by the 52nd and 57th Divisions, directed its
main force on the triangle of fortifications, marking
the junction of the Hindenburg and Drocourt-Quéant
lines, north-west of the village of Quéant.
Pressed with equal vigour it met with success
equally complete. There was stern fighting in the
net-work of trenches, both north and south of
Quéant, in which neighbourhood the 52nd (Lowland)
Division performed distinguished service,
and, by the progress they made, greatly assisted
our advance further north. Early in the afternoon
our troops had cleared the triangle and the 63rd
Division had passed through to exploit the success
thus gained.”</p>

<p>The fighting on 2nd-3rd September is now the
“Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant line.”</p>

<p>In a telegraphic despatch of 20th September
Sir Douglas Haig said: “On the 17th a corporal
and six men of the 1/5th Highland Light Infantry,
52nd Division, forming garrison of one of our posts
just north of the village, were surrounded and
believed to have been captured. During two days
Germans held the village this party maintained
their position and inflicted many casualties on the
enemy. On the night of 19th-20th, when Mœuvres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
was retaken, the whole party regained their unit
without loss.”</p>

<p>The very gallant N.C.O. was awarded the Victoria
Cross. The village was retaken by the 52nd Division.</p>

<p>The XVII. Corps was again employed on 27th
September, “the Battle of Cambrai and the Hindenburg
line.” Paragraph 35 of the despatch states:
“In the centre the 52nd Division, Major-General
F. J. Marshall, passing its troops across the canal
by bridgeheads previously established by the 57th
Division,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on the opening of the assault, carried the
German trench lines east of the canal and gained
the high ground overlooking Graincourt.”</p>

<p>The advance was continued successfully by the
XVII. Corps between 27th September and 1st
October, the 52nd doing particularly well, not only
at the crossing of the Canal du Nord but in the
capture of the heavily wired defences on either
side of it.</p>

<p>The designation of the fighting 27th September-1st
October, has been altered by the Nomenclature
Committee and is now the “Battle of the Canal du
Nord.” They have fixed the dates of the “Battle
of Cambrai, 1918,” to be 8th and 9th October.</p>

<p>Early in October the Division left the XVII. Corps
and later that month took over from the 12th
Division in the VIII. Corps, Fifth Army.</p>

<p>With short intervals of rest the Division continued
in the line of the advance until Armistice Day. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
crossed the Belgian frontier south of Péruvelz, and
moving eastward by Sirault, were about ten miles
north of Mons on 11th November. During these
last few weeks there was frequently stubborn
opposition which involved sharp fighting.</p>

<p>The 5th King’s Own Scottish Borderers, 8th
Scottish Rifles, and 5th Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders of the 52nd served during the last
five months in the 34th Division (Major-General
Nicholson), which after suffering heavy losses in
the German offensive of March and April was
reconstituted largely with battalions from the
Palestine Divisions. It served with the French
Tenth Army, south of Soissons in July 1918, and
was highly complimented by General Mangin, the
Army Commander. The battalions from the 52nd
seem to have done exceptionally well both south of
Soissons and at the capture of Gheluwe in Belgium,
14th October, and Anseghem, 31st October,
when the 34th was advancing as part of the X.
Corps, Second Army. The 34th Division reached
Halluin.</p>

<p>The 5th and 6th battalions, Scottish Rifles, and
9th Highland Light Infantry lost their places in
the Division through going to France early in the
war. Indeed the 5th Scottish Rifles was one of the
first Territorial battalions to be employed in that
theatre, the 5th and 6th were eventually amalgamated.
The fine work of all three battalions when
in the 33rd Division was very frequently praised
by unofficial historians.</p>

<p>These three units were replaced by the 4th and
7th Battalions, The Royal Scots, and the 5th Argyll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
and Sutherland Highlanders, all from “Army
Troops.”</p>

<p>The following units were selected for the Armies
of Occupation on the Western Front: the 5/6th
Royal Scots, which served as separate battalions in
the Near East, the 5th Battalion landing at Helles
with the 29th Division, and, after amalgamation,
in France with the 32nd Division; the 1/4th Royal
Scots Fusiliers; the 1/5th King’s Own Scottish
Borderers; the 5/6th Scottish Rifles; the 1/8th
Scottish Rifles; and the 1/9th Highland Light
Infantry.</p>

<p>The 32nd Division formed part of the Fourth
Army throughout the “Advance to Victory.” In
Major-General Montgomery’s <cite>Story of the Fourth
Army</cite> there are several flattering references to the
work of the 5/6th Royal Scots, as at p. 178, 3rd
October, where he refers to their capture of Sequehart
and its retention after the third time of capture—“partly
also to the stubborn manner in which
the 5/6th Royal Scots clung to the village it had
three times captured.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">The Division landed at Suvla Bay, Gallipoli,
between 7th and 10th August, 1915, and became a
part of the larger force which landed a few days
earlier.</p>

<p>In his despatch of 11th December, 1915, Sir Ian
Hamilton describes the attempt made on the 9th
August by the 11th Division to seize hills north of
Anafarta-Sagir. He remarked, “The line was later
on prolonged by the remainder of the 34th Brigade
and two battalions of the 159th Brigade of the
53rd Division. Their right was connected with
the Chocolate Hills by the 33rd Brigade.” “Some
of the units which took part in this engagement
acquitted themselves very bravely. I regret I have
not had sufficient detail given me to mention them
by name. The Divisional Commander speaks with
appreciation of one freshly landed battalion of the
53rd Division, a Hereford battalion, presumably
the 1/1st Herefordshire, which attacked with
impetuosity and courage.” “During the night
of the 8th and 9th and early morning of the 9th
the whole of the 53rd (Territorial) Division (my
general reserve) had arrived and disembarked....
I had ordered it up to Suvla.” “The infantry
brigades of the 53rd Division (no artillery had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
accompanied it from England) reinforced the 11th
Division.”</p>

<p>The next paragraph shows that the 53rd Division
took part in another attack on the 10th which
failed. “Many of the battalions fought with great
gallantry and were led forward with much devotion
by their officers.”</p>

<p>The 53rd Division along with the 54th were engaged
on the 21st August, the “Battle of Scimitar
Hill.” They were to hold the enemy while the
29th and 11th Divisions attacked. The attack
was not successful.</p>

<p>The troops at Suvla were evacuated in December
1915, the operation being successfully completed
on the night of 19th-20th December.</p>

<p>The Division was taken to Egypt, and in his
despatch of 1st June, 1916, paragraph 1, Sir A.
Murray stated that the Division was early that year
“occupied in operations on the Western Frontier
of Egypt.”</p>

<p>Sir A. Murray in his despatch of 1st October,
1916, paragraph 5, refers to the fighting in August,
to the east of the Suez Canal, and a quotation as
to the repulse of heavy attacks on 4th-5th August
has already been given under the 52nd Division.
This is now designated the “Battle of Rumani.”</p>

<p>In his despatch of 28th June, 1917, paragraph 1,
Sir A. Murray refers to the reconstitution of the
“Desert Column” and mentions the 53rd Division
as one of its units in March.</p>

<p>The Division bore a leading part in the “First
Battle of Gaza,” 26th-27th March, 1917. Paragraph
2 of the despatch last mentioned shows that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the 53rd Division was “to attack Gaza in front,” their
left being covered by the Gloucestershire Hussars
among the sandhills on the coast. The approach
march was made on the 25th and early on the 26th.</p>

<p>Paragraph 3: “Meanwhile the 53rd Division,
under the command of Major-General A. G. Dallas,
C.B., C.M.G., having thrown forward strong bridgeheads
before dawn,” (on the 26th) “crossed the
Wadi Ghuzze at a point some three miles from the
sea-coast, with one brigade on the right directed
on the Mansura Ridge, and another brigade on the
left directed on El Sheluf, some two miles south of
Gaza, on the ridge running south-west from that
place. A brigade was held in reserve.” A brigade
of the 54th was placed at the disposal of the G.O.C.
53rd Division when required.</p>

<p>“The deployment of the leading brigades commenced
at 11.50 a.m., and the brigade in reserve
moved forward shortly afterwards to its assigned
position. In co-operation with artillery fire and
long-range machine-gun fire, the brigade on the
left pressed forward along the ridge, and the remaining
brigades over the flat, open ground, practically
devoid of cover. The final advance, which
began just after 1 p.m., was very steady, and all the
troops behaved magnificently, though the enemy
offered a very stout resistance, both with rifle and
machine-gun fire, and our advancing troops, during
the approach march, the deployment and attack,
were subjected to a heavy shrapnel fire.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon the mounted troops attacked Gaza
from north and north-east, and enveloped it, having
heavy fighting among the gardens and enclosures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>Paragraph 4: “Meanwhile the infantry attack was
being pressed with great vigour, and by 4.30 p.m.
considerable progress had been made. Portions of
the enemy’s positions were already in our hands
and shortly afterwards the Ali Muntar Hill, a strong
work known as the Labyrinth, and the ground in
the immediate neighbourhood fell into our hands.
The Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division
was already exerting pressure on the enemy, and
by 5 p.m. the enemy was holding out in the trenches
and on the hill south of the Mosque only. The
G.O.C. 53rd Division called on the brigade of the
54th Division (Brigadier-General W. Marriott-Dodington)
which had been placed at his disposal
to take this position. The brigade responded with
the greatest gallantry in face of a heavy fire and
after some hard fighting it pushed home its attack
with complete success, so that when darkness fell
the whole of the Ali Muntar position had been
carried and a footing gained on the ridge to a point
about 1200 yards north-east of that position.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 5 deals with the “strong columns of
the enemy” moving to the relief of Gaza, and other
facts which compelled certain withdrawals to be
undertaken.</p>

<p>In paragraph 6 occurs the sentence, “Nevertheless,
though tired and ill-supplied with water the
53rd and 54th Divisions now placed under the
G.O.C. 53rd remained throughout the day (27th)
staunch and cheerful and perfectly capable of
repulsing with heavy losses to the enemy any
Turkish counter-attacks.”</p>

<p>The Turks had been very strongly reinforced, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
although a strong counter-attack at 4 p.m. was
shattered it was decided to retire to the west of the
Wadi Ghuzze. This was carried out during the night.</p>

<p>At the close of paragraph 7 Sir A. Murray said:
“The troops engaged, both cavalry, camelry and infantry,
especially the 53rd Division and the brigade
of the 54th, which had not been seriously in action
since the evacuation of Suvla Bay at the end of
1915, fought with the utmost gallantry and endurance
and showed to the full the splendid fighting
qualities which they possess.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 8 deals with the preparations for a
second attack on the Gaza positions. For that
operation the possession of the Wadi Ghuzze was
necessary, so that the effort of 26th-27th March
was not wasted.</p>

<p>The 17th April was the day fixed for the beginning
of the second attack. In his despatch Sir A. Murray
said, paragraph 9, that the “53rd Division, under
the command of Major-General S. F. Mott, was to
remain in position just north of the Wadi Ghuzze
between the sea and the Gaza-Khan-Yunus road,
but to carry out strong reconnaissances northward
along the coast.”</p>

<p>In the final stage of the attack “the 53rd Division
was to attack the enemy’s trenches in the sand-dunes
south-west and west of Gaza, the line Sampson
Ridge-Sheikh Ajlin being its first objective.”
The Division advanced at 7.15 a.m. on the 19th;
“though meeting with considerable opposition,
they gradually worked up to Sampson Ridge which
was carried by a brigade early in the afternoon.
This enabled another brigade to carry the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
ground between this position and the coast with
little opposition—and the first objective of the
Division was attained.”</p>

<p>At nightfall “the 53rd Division held the Sampson
Ridge-Sheikh Ajlin line,” but other parts of the
force had not attained their objectives, casualties
had been very heavy, about 7000, and the attack
was abandoned. The ground gained was kept and
consolidated. (See also 52nd and 54th Divisions.)</p>

<p>Sir E. Allenby assumed command of the Egyptian
Expeditionary Force in June 1917, and the successful
operations which began with the capture of Beersheba
on 31st October, and ended with the surrender
of Jerusalem on 9th December, are detailed in his
despatch of 16th December, 1917.</p>

<p>The 53rd Division was, in these operations, on
the right of the line. On 27th October the Turks
attacked a line of outposts; paragraph 6: “The
gallant resistance made by the Yeomanry enabled
the 53rd (Welsh) Division to come up in time, and
on their advance the Turks withdrew.” On the
same date the British bombardment of the Gaza
defences commenced.</p>

<p>Paragraph 10, 1st November: The 53rd (Welsh)
Division after a long march took up a position
from six miles north of Beersheba to Muweileh.
Between the 1st and 5th November the Division
had sometimes heavy fighting.</p>

<p>Paragraph 11: “The 53rd (Welsh) Division had
again had very severe fighting on the 6th. Their
attack at dawn on Tel el Khuweilfeh was successful,
and though they were driven off a hill by a
counter-attack, they retook it and captured another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
hill, which much improved their position. The
Turkish losses in this area were very heavy indeed,
and the stubborn fighting of the 53rd Division, the
Imperial Camel Corps and part of the mounted
troops during 2nd to 6th November drew in and
exhausted the Turkish reserves, and paved the way
for the success of the attack on Sheria. The 53rd
Division took several hundred prisoners and some
guns during this fighting.”</p>

<p>The various actions 27th October to 7th November
are now designated the “Third Battle of Gaza.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 21: An attack on the Jerusalem
defences was fixed for 8th December, the 53rd
Division marched up the Hebron-Jerusalem road
and met little opposition from the enemy. Heavy
rains on the 7th and following days delayed the
column but on the 9th “Welsh troops occupied a
position east of Jerusalem across the Jericho road,”
the 60th Division being to the north of the city.
At noon the city was surrendered. (See also 60th
Division.)</p>

<p>In Sir E. Allenby’s second despatch dated 18th
September, 1918, he deals with the operations undertaken
to provide more effectively for the security
of Jerusalem and of Jaffa (see 52nd Division).
The XX. Corps, including the 53rd and 60th
Divisions, had been ordered to make an advance
on a twelve-mile front to a depth of six miles north
of Jerusalem, but in the meantime “the enemy
attacked with great determination astride the
Jerusalem-Nablus-Sechem road,” on December
26th-27th. The 60th was heavily engaged but
beat off the enemy with loss. Paragraph 5: “In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
the meantime the enemy had delivered attacks
against various points held by the 53rd Division
east of Jerusalem. On the extreme right at Kh.
Deir Ibn Obeid a company of Middlesex troops was
surrounded by 700 Turks, supported by mountain
artillery. Although without artillery support, it
offered a most gallant resistance, holding out till
relief came on the morning of the 28th. None of
the other attacks on this division’s front were any
more successful.” “By the evening of December
30th the XX. Corps had advanced on a front of
twelve miles to a depth varying from six miles on
the right to three miles on the left. This advance
had to overcome not only a determined and obstinate
resistance, but great natural difficulties as well,
which had to be overcome before guns could be
brought up to support the infantry.” 750 prisoners
were taken, and 1000 Turkish dead were buried.
The fighting 26th-30th December is now designated
the “Defence of Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>The despatch, paragraph 7, shows that the 60th
and 53rd Divisions were engaged in the operations
leading to the capture of Jericho, 20th-21st February,
1918.</p>

<p>On 9th, 10th and 11th March further operations
were undertaken in which the fighting was of a
bitter character. Paragraph 8: On the 9th “the 53rd
Division on the right had met with considerable
opposition and great natural difficulties especially
on the extreme right and at Tell-Asur, a conspicuous
landmark among a mass of high hills. The importance
attached to it by the enemy was shown by the
number of determined efforts he made to recapture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
it, all of which were repulsed.” Progress continued
on the 10th and 11th.</p>

<p>In his third despatch, dated 31st October, Sir
E. Allenby describes his final operations, now
designated “The Battles of Megiddo,” which led
to the armistice with Turkey. The main attack
was on the coastal plain, that is on the left of the
line, the 53rd Division and the 10th Division to
make an advance on the right of the line some
twelve hours later.</p>

<p>Paragraph 13: “During the night of September
18th-19th the XX. Corps swung forward its right
on the east of the Bireh-Nablus road. The 53rd
Division descended into the basin at the head of
the Wadi Samieh, captured Kh. Jibeit, El Mugheir
and the ridge on the far side of the basin and all
its objectives with the exception of one hill, Kh.
Abu Malul. Considerable opposition was encountered
and hand-to-hand fighting took place in which
over 400 prisoners were taken.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 16: On the morning of the 19th “I
ordered the XX. Corps to advance that night on
Nablus.” The enemy had long expected such an
attack and his defences were strong and “the task
of the Corps was a difficult one. The enemy in this
portion of the field was not disorganised and was
able to oppose a stout resistance to the advance.
The country is broken and rugged, demanding great
physical exertion on the part of the troops and preventing
the artillery keeping pace with the infantry.
Nevertheless good progress was made on the night
of September 19th, and during the following day.
The 53rd Division captured Kh. Abu Malul and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
advanced their line in the centre. On their right
Khan Jibeit was heavily counter-attacked on the
morning of September 20th. The Turks succeeded
in regaining the hill but were driven off again after
a sharp fight.” By the evening of the 21st the
XX. Corps had reached a line which extended to
the N.E. of Nablus. After that date the fighting
operations were mainly within the sphere of the
cavalry and armoured cars, but the infantry had
some severe marching and other hardships. On
31st October the Armistice with Turkey came into
force.</p>

<p>The Division was unfortunate in losing several
of its original units before it went abroad, the 1/4th
Royal Welsh Fusiliers, 1/5th and 1/6th Cheshire
Regiment and 1/1st, 1/2nd and 1/3rd Monmouth
Regiment having been taken to the Western front
early in the war. The 1/4th and 1/5th Welsh
Regiment, originally Army Troops, the 1/4th Royal
Sussex, 2/4th Royal West Surrey, 2/4th Royal West
Kent and 2/10th Middlesex took the place of the
units which had left the Division. In the despatch
of 14th January, 1915, Sir John French gave
mention to several officers and men of the 2nd
Monmouth Regiment for good work at the First
Battle of Ypres, and in his despatch of 31st May,
1915, officers and men of the 1/5th Cheshire and
1/2nd and 1/3rd Monmouth gained mention. The
1/1st Monmouth was Pioneer battalion to the 46th
(North Midland) Division and shared its glory on
29th September, 1918, when they crossed the St.
Quentin canal, captured Bellenglise and broke the
Hindenburg line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>The 1/4th Royal Welsh Fusiliers served as Pioneers
to the 47th Division and during the Retreat,
March 1918, did outstanding work, particularly on
the 24th when acting as rearguard.</p>

<p>The 6th Cheshire is mentioned by Sir A. Conan
Doyle, volume iv. p. 146, as in a Territorial brigade
of the 39th Division which on 31st July, 1917, in
the Third Battle of Ypres, made an attack which
was “extraordinarily gallant,” “greater constancy
has seldom been seen.” The same battalion was in
the awful fighting on the Aisne at the end of May
1918, when three divisions of the IX. Corps were
destroyed. An account of the battle is to be found
in the <cite>History of the 25th Division</cite> (Harrison).</p>

<p>As stated under the 52nd, the divisions in Palestine
sent battalions to France to reinforce the army
there after the losses incurred by it in the great
German offensive. The 1/4th Cheshire, 1/1st Hereford
and 1/4th Sussex were put into the 34th Division
and fought with it in the great battle south
of Soissons, July 1918, when Marshal Foch crushed
in the sides of the salient between the Aisne and
the Marne.</p>

<p>The following units, either belonging to the 53rd
Division, or which had served with it, were chosen
for the Army of Occupation on the Western Front:
1/4th and 1/6th Cheshire Regiment, 2/4th Royal
West Surrey and 1/4th Sussex Regiment. The
1/6th Welsh Regiment, originally Army Troops,
was also selected.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In his despatch of 11th December 1915, dealing
with the operations at Suvla Bay, Gallipoli, Sir Ian
Hamilton said: “The 54th Division, infantry only,
arrived and were disembarked on August 11th and
placed in reserve. On the following day, August
12th, I proposed that the 54th Division should
make a night-march in order to attack, at dawn on
the 13th, the heights Kavak Tepe-Teke Tepe.”
“That afternoon the 163rd Brigade moved off and
in spite of serious opposition established itself
about the A of Anafarta in difficult and enclosed
country. In the course of the fight, creditable in
all respects to the 163rd Brigade, there happened a
very mysterious thing. The 1/5th Norfolks were
on the right of the line and found themselves for
a moment less strongly opposed than the rest of
the brigade, Against the yielding forces of the
enemy Colonel Sir H. Beauchamp, a bold, self-confident
officer, eagerly pressed forward, followed
by the best part of the battalion. The fighting grew
hotter, and the ground became more wooded and
broken. At this stage many men were wounded
or grew exhausted with thirst. These found their
way back to camp during the night. But the
colonel, with 16 officers and 250 men, still kept
pushing on, driving the enemy before him. Amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
these ardent souls was part of a fine company
enlisted from the King’s Sandringham estates.
Nothing more was ever seen or heard of any of
them. They charged into the forest and were lost
to sight and sound. Not one of them ever came
back.”</p>

<p>Owing to representations by the Corps Commander
the night march and projected attack on
the 13th were abandoned.</p>

<p>The 162nd Brigade of the 54th Division were in
support in an attack on 15th August, and on the
21st, the “Battle of Scimitar Hill,” “the 53rd
and 54th were to hold the enemy from Sulajik to
Kiretch Tepe Sirt, while the 29th Division and
the 11th Division stormed Ismail Oglu Tepe.”
These attacks met with little success. During the
ensuing four months the Suvla Force held on to the
ground it had won, but with ever-increasing difficulty,
as sickness and casualties had sadly thinned
its ranks.</p>

<p>On the night of the 19th-20th December, 1915,
the evacuation from Suvla and Anzac was completed.</p>

<p>The 54th Division sailed for Egypt and down to
the close of the war remained part of the Egyptian
Expeditionary Force. Shortly after landing in Egypt
part of the Division was employed as Lines of
Communication troops for the column working
on the western frontier. (See Sir J. G. Maxwell’s
despatch of 1st March, 1916.)</p>

<p>When Sir A. Murray proceeded to press back
the Turks in Palestine the 54th Division was
employed—quotations from the despatch of 28th
June, 1917, as to the action of 26th-27th March,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
1917, the “First Battle of Gaza,” are given under
the 53rd Division.</p>

<p>In the despatch of 28th June, 1917, as to the
“Second Battle of Gaza,” paragraph 9, Sir A. Murray
stated that on 17th April, 1917, the 54th and 52nd
“were to seize and occupy the line Sheik-Abbas-Mansura-Kurd
Hill,” that line was taken by 7 a.m.</p>

<p>On the 19th these two divisions were to attack the
Ali Muntar group of works south of Gaza, the 54th
pivoting on the right of the 52nd; unfortunately
the latter division was held up, see 52nd Division.
“Meanwhile the 54th Division with the Imperial
Camel Corps had advanced steadily under fire on
the right of the 52nd Division. Its left brigade was
in advance of the right of the rear brigade of the
52nd Division, and thus exposed to a heavy enfilade
fire from the direction of Ali Muntar. At 9.30 a.m.
the left of this brigade was heavily counter-attacked,
but the enemy were repulsed by machine-gun fire.
On the right of this brigade another brigade fought
its way forward against the enemy works between
Gaza and Khirbet Sihan.” These were entered by
the Camel Corps. The two brigades, “in spite of
most strenuous and gallant efforts to advance, were
repeatedly checked by very heavy fire from this
front. Towards noon the left of the right brigade
was forced back by a determined counter-attack
from the north-east,” but with the assistance of
the third brigade it was able to regain the ground
lost.</p>

<p>At 3 p.m.: “Reports received from the 54th
Division stated that the situation was satisfactory,
and that no help was required to enable the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
gained to be held until further progress by the 52nd
should render practicable a renewal of the advance.
I should like to state here my appreciation of the
great skill with which General Hare handled his
fine Division throughout the day.” A counter-attack
by the Turks at 3.30 p.m. “was shattered.”
The attack was not pressed further, but the ground
gained was consolidated.</p>

<p>Sir E. Allenby took command of the Egyptian
Expeditionary Force at the end of June, 1917,
and his first despatch, that of 16th December, 1917,
shows that in the “Third Battle of Gaza” his main
attack on the Gaza-Beersheba line, 27th October-7th
November, was from the British right (see 53rd
and 60th Divisions), but it was essential to compel
the enemy to throw in his reserves at the western
end of the line and, to ensure that, the 52nd and
54th Divisions on 2nd and 3rd November assaulted
the positions guarding Gaza on the south and west.
On the 3rd the 54th after stiff fighting captured
several strongly fortified positions, notably the El
Arish redoubt, taken by the 1/4th and 1/5th Norfolks,
the Rafa redoubt and other posts, taken by
the 1/5th and 1/6th Essex, while other battalions
of the Division seized the Belah trenches and Turtle
Hill. (See Dane’s <cite>British Campaigns in the Nearer
East</cite>, Hodder and Stoughton, vol. ii. p. 91.)
Very heavy counter-attacks to recapture these
positions, which were of great importance, were
launched by the Turks but these were repulsed
with heavy loss to the enemy.</p>

<p>Between the 3rd and 6th the hardest fighting
took place east of Gaza, and the enemy’s line was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
broken there. The despatch, paragraph 12, notes
that “East Anglian troops on the left also found at
dawn” (on the 7th) “that the enemy had retired
during the night, and early in the morning the main
force occupied the northern and eastern defences
of Gaza.”</p>

<p>The 54th took part in the pursuit and the British
advance to the line Jaffa-Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Sir E. Allenby’s second despatch, that of 18th
September, 1918, shows that the 54th was, along
with the 52nd, in the XXI. Corps to which was
given the task of increasing the distance between
Joppa, or Jaffa, and the enemy. This was duly
accomplished on 21st and 22nd December, 1917,
in what is now designated the “Battle of Jaffa” (see
also 52nd Division). Paragraph 4 of the despatch
states that “on the morning of 22nd December,
the 54th Division on the right drove the enemy
from the orchards which surround Mulebbis and
captured the villages of Rantieh and Fejja. On the
left the 52nd reached all their objectives.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 8 of the despatch shows that early in
March the XXI. Corps made a further advance. The
54th captured five villages and some prisoners, and,
paragraph 16, the Corps again moved forward, 9th
to 11th April, when other positions were taken and
held against the heavy counter-attacks in which
the enemy’s losses were considerable, “over 300
of his dead being counted”.</p>

<p>In his last despatch, that of 31st October, 1918,
Sir E. Allenby described how his infantry broke
through the Turkish lines and opened the gate for
the cavalry and armoured cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>Paragraph 15: “The attack on the coastal plain
on the morning of September 19th was attended
with complete success. On the right, in the foothills,
the French Tirailleurs and the Armenians of
the Légion d’Orient advanced with great dash.”
“On their left the 54th Division stormed Kefr
Kasim village and wood and the foothills overlooking
the railway from Ras El Ain to Jiljulieh.
North of Kefr Kasim the advance was checked for
a time at Sivri Tepe, but the enemy’s resistance
was quickly overcome and the remaining hills south
of the Wadi Kanah captured.” “The 3rd, Lahore,
Division pressed on eastwards into the foothills,
near Hableh, joining hands with the 54th Division
north of the Wadi Kanah.” Later the 7th, Meerut,
3rd, Lahore, and 54th Divisions advanced further
in an easterly direction.</p>

<p>After this the infantry of the XXI. Corps were
never seriously opposed but they had many most
severe marches during the next three weeks.</p>

<p>Like its neighbour in the East, the 53rd, the 54th
Division lost some good battalions before it went
abroad as a division. The policy pursued in 1914
and first half of 1915 of “picking the eyes out of”
Territorial divisions has been severely animadverted
upon, by, among others, Sir Ian Hamilton, and no
one was better qualified than he was to judge of
the wisdom or folly of this proceeding.</p>

<p>The 1st Hertfordshire Regiment, the 1st Cambridgeshire
Regiment and the 4th Suffolk Regiment,
originally units of the 54th Division, went early to
France. The Hertfordshire battalion was mentioned
in Sir John French’s despatch of 20th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
November, 1914, as among the territorial battalions
which took part in the First Battle of Ypres (see 56th
Division). The despatch of 2nd February 1915,
paragraph 4, shows that the 4th Suffolk Regiment
was part of a force making a counter-attack near
Givenchy on 20th December, 1914. “About 5 p.m.
a gallant attack by the 1st Manchester Regiment
and one company 4th Suffolk Regiment had
captured Givenchy, and had cleared the enemy out
of two lines of trenches to the north-east.”</p>

<p>In the despatch of 15th June, 1915, as to the
Second Battle of Ypres, 22nd April to 25th May,
the great gas attack, the Commander-in-Chief,
quoting Sir Herbert Plumer, gives some examples
of “individual gallantry,” among these he mentions
the visit by a patrol, two officers and one N.C.O.
of the 1st Cambridgeshire to a German trench,
350 yards away. The adventurous party, with
great good fortune, got safely back to their own
trench. Officers and men of these units were
mentioned by Sir John French.</p>

<p>The places of these three battalions in the 54th
Division were taken by the 1/10th and 1/11th
County of London Regiment from the 56th Division
and the 1/8th Hampshire, a Wessex battalion.</p>

<p>Sir A. Conan Doyle, volume iv. p. 198, draws
attention to the fine work of the 33rd Division in
the Third Battle of Ypres on 26th September, 1917,
and among other battalions highly spoken of is the
4th Suffolks. In the same volume, p. 146, he refers
to the 1st Hertfordshire and 1st Cambridgeshire,
then both in the 39th Division, in terms of praise,
for their conduct in the same battle on 31st July.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
In volume v. p. 117, he mentions the 1st Hertfordshire,
39th Division, as retaking “in very gallant
fashion,” on 22nd March, 1918, a village which
had been lost, and says the battalion had greatly
distinguished itself at St. Julien and elsewhere.
In volume vi. he refers to the gallantry and
steadiness of that battalion in connection with the
action about Trescault, 18th September, 1918,
and in the same volume, pp. 33, 62 and 287, he
gives great credit to the 1st Cambridgeshire for
fine conduct on three occasions in 1918, when
serving with the 12th Division.</p>

<p>These words of praise mean much, as throughout
the work individual battalions are not often
mentioned.</p>

<p>The following units which had either belonged
originally to the 54th or had fought with it were
chosen for the Armies of Occupation: The Rhine,
1/4th Suffolk Regiment; Egypt and Palestine, 1/4th
Norfolk Regiment, 1/5th Suffolk Regiment, 1/4th,
1/5th and 1/7th Essex Regiment, 1/4th Northamptonshire
Regiment and 1/10th London Regiment.</p>

<span class="smcap">First Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">As in the case of some other good divisions, the
55th, as a unit, suffered because its individual
battalions were early ready and eager to go to
France. Had it been otherwise the history of the
Division would have been at least one year longer.
The 10th Liverpool Regiment went to France in
October 1914, and the other battalions followed
during the succeeding six months. For the most
part the battalions were, on landing, attached to
Regular brigades. The 5th Royal Lancaster, 5th,
7th and 9th Liverpool, and 5th South Lancashire
all bore a conspicuous part in the Second Battle of
Ypres, now “The Battles of Ypres, 1915,” the gas
attack, April and May 1915, and nobly helped to
stem the German flood; or in the battles of Richebourg-St.-Vaast-Festubert,
9th-16th May, 1915.
The North Lancashire Brigade was attached to the
51st, Highland, Division and played a prominent
part in that division’s first battle on 15th-16th
June. The 4th Loyal North Lancashire, 4th Royal
Lancaster and 8th Liverpool all fought with distinction
in that engagement and suffered very heavy
losses. On the same day, 16th June, the 10th Liverpool,
now a band of veteran soldiers, was employed
with the 3rd Division in an attack at Hooge and
made a fine, almost over-eager, advance. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
losses are said by Sir A. Conan Doyle to have exceeded
400. The Division was represented in the
Loos battle, September 1915, by the 9th Liverpool.</p>

<p>In Sir John French’s despatch of 14th January,
1915, giving the names of those who had distinguished
themselves prior to the end of November
1914, he mentions an officer and N.C.O. of the 10th
Liverpool, and in that of 31st May, 1915, officers
and men of the 5th Royal Lancaster, 10th Liverpool,
4th South Lancashire and 5th Loyal North
Lancashire. Subsequently other names were mentioned
for the Ypres battle and for the battles
about Festubert.</p>

<p>The individual battalions were brought together,
and the Division reconstituted as a unit, under
Major-General H. S. Jeudwine, in January 1916.
By that date several battalions had few of their
original members on their strength.</p>

<p>In February the Division joined the XIV. Corps
south of Arras. At the end of July they were taken
to the Somme. On 30th July the Division entered
the line under the XIV. Corps opposite Guillemont
on the extreme right of the British Army, the
French being their neighbours on the right flank.
On 8th, 9th and 12th August the Division attacked
and a certain amount of ground was gained and
consolidated, but the village was not taken. From
16th August to 4th September they were at rest
and then entered the line under the XV. Corps
near Delville Wood. They took part in an attack
on 9th September, the “Battle of Ginchy.”</p>

<p>The despatch from Sir Douglas Haig of 23rd
December, 1916, deals with the Somme battle. Paragraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
29 (Dent’s edition), shows that the 55th was
employed in the big attack by the Fourth Army
beginning on 25th September, now designated the
“Battle of Morval.” The objectives “included a
belt of country about 1000 yards deep, curving
round the north of Flers to a point midway between
that village and Martinpuich (55th Division, Major-General
H. S. Jeudwine, and New Zealand and 1st
Divisions).” These objectives were gained.</p>

<p>Paragraph 31 states: “On the Fourth Army front
on 27th September a further portion of the enemy’s
fourth system of defence north-west of Gueudecourt
was carried on a front of a mile by the 55th and
New Zealand Divisions.” A further “very considerable
advance,” was made in the afternoon and
evening.</p>

<p>On the night of the 28th September, the Division
left the line and was ordered to the Ypres salient.
The Commander of the Fourth Army sent them a
message which spoke of their good work and their
“spirit of gallantry and endurance.”</p>

<p>The Division was still in the salient when the
great attack of 31st July, 1917, took place. That
assault was the beginning of the Third Battle of
Ypres, now “The Battles of Ypres, 1917.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 25th December,
1917, paragraph 41 (Dent’s edition), deals with the
initial assault launched at 3.50 a.m. on 31st July,
and states: “At 9 a.m. the whole of our second objectives
north of the Ypres-Roulers railway were in
our possession with the exception of a strong point
north of Frezenberg, known as Pommern Redoubt,
where fighting was still going on. Within an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
this redoubt had also been captured by West Lancashire
Territorials (55th Division).” In this attack the
Division was in the XIX. Corps, Fifth Army. See
note, Messrs. Dent’s edition, p. 113. The operations
31st July-2nd August are now designated the “Battle
of Pilckem Ridge.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 50 of the same despatch gives an
account of the attack launched at 5.40 a.m. on 20th
September (the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge),
“a most successful operation,” notwithstanding the
excessively bad state of the ground. “West Lancashire
Territorials (55th Division) found the ground
south-east of St. Julien very wet and heavy after
the night’s rain. None the less, they made steady
progress, reaching the line of their final objectives
early in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, the losses of the Division in the
Third Battle of Ypres were heavy.</p>

<p>In the last week of September the Division left
the salient after over eleven months’ service there.
They were taken to the Epéhy district south-west
of Cambrai and at once entered the line.</p>

<p>The Division held the right of the battle line when
the British attacked on 20th November, 1917
(the “Battle of Cambrai, 1917”)· In his telegraphic
despatch of 21st November, Sir Douglas Haig said:
“West Lancashire Territorials broke through positions
about Epéhy.” This part of the attack was
really a feint or holding attack, but it cost the
Division heavy casualties.</p>

<p>On 30th November the enemy made his great
counter-attack with very strong forces. The Division
held the southern part of the British line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
where it was attacked. The Divisional frontage
was nearly eight miles, and as it was impossible to
man a continuous line, it was held by posts. Another
British division was on the right of the 55th but
it was not seriously involved in the fighting on 20th
and 30th November.</p>

<p>The battle is described in paragraphs 9 and 10
of the despatch of 20th February, 1918.</p>

<p>Paragraph 9 states: “From the Banteux ravine
southwards the divisions in line were weak and held
very extended fronts.” “In view of the symptoms
of activity observed on the enemy’s front, special
precautions were taken by local commanders, especially
from Villers Guislain to the south.” The map
opposite p. 163 of Messrs. Dent’s edition shows the
latter portion to have been in the area of the 55th
Division.</p>

<p>Paragraph 10: “Between the hours of 7 and 8 a.m.
on the last day of November, the enemy attacked,
after a short but intense artillery preparation, on
the greater part of a front of some ten miles, from
Vendhuille” (on our right) “to Masnières” (on
our left) “inclusive. From Masnières to Banteux,
both inclusive, four German divisions would seem
to have been employed against the three British
divisions holding this area (29th, 20th and 12th).”
The map above referred to shows these are from
left to right. “Between Banteux exclusive and
Vendhuille one German division and portions of
two others were employed against the northern
half of the British division holding that front (the
55th Division, Major-General H. S. Jeudwine).”</p>

<p>“At the northern end of the Bonavis Ridge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
and in the Gonnelieu sector<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the swiftness with which
the advance of the enemy’s infantry followed the
opening of his bombardment appears to have overwhelmed
our troops, both in line and in immediate
support, almost before they had realised that the
attack had begun.”</p>

<p>“East of Villers Guislain<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the troops holding our
forward positions on the high ground were still
offering a strenuous resistance to the enemy’s attack
on their front, at a time when large forces of German
infantry had already advanced up the valley between
them and Villers Guislain. South of this village a
single strong point known as Limerick Post, garrisoned
by troops of the 1/5th Battalion (King’s
Own), Royal Lancaster Regiment and the 1/10th
Battalion, Liverpool Regiment (both of the 55th
Division), held out with great gallantry throughout
the day, although heavily attacked.</p>

<p>“The progress made by the enemy, however,
across the northern end of the Bonavis Ridge and
up the deep gully between Villers Guislain and
Gonnelieu, known as 22 Ravine, turned our positions
on the ridge as well as in both villages.”</p>

<p>Towards the close of the despatch, paragraph 15,
Sir Douglas Haig said: “On the 30th November
risks were accepted by us at some points in order
to increase our strength at others. Our fresh reserves
had been thrown in on the Bourlon front,
where the enemy brought against us a total force
of seven divisions to three and failed. I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
consider it would have been justifiable on the
indications to have allotted a smaller garrison to
this front.” And again: “Though the defence broke
down for a time in one area the recovery made by
the weak forces still left and those within reach is
worthy of the highest praise. Numberless instances
of great gallantry, promptitude and skill were shown,
some few of which have been recounted.”</p>

<p>It would be against the spirit of what has been
said in the introduction if any stress were laid here
on what a unit said about itself, but in view of the
discussion which took place on the events of 30th
November it does seem fair to say that in the <cite>Story
of the 55th Division</cite> (<cite>Liverpool Daily Post</cite> Office),
there is quoted a letter from the Commander of the
VII. Corps, under which the Division was serving
on the 30th, in which he said: “He knows that the
30th November, 1917, in spite of the heavy losses
incurred, was a day which will always reflect credit
on the 55th Division. The fact that not a man
returned from the 5th South Lancashire Regiment”
(the battalion next the ravine) “when that battalion
was attacked by overwhelming numbers, tells its
own tale.” In a message on another occasion he
said: “It cannot be contradicted by anyone that
the 55th saved the day on November 30th, 1917.
You got a most infernal hammering, but you saved
the day.”</p>

<p>On 8th December the Division was relieved and
shortly afterwards moved north. After two months’
training, when much-needed drafts were absorbed,
the Division entered the line in the Givenchy-Festubert
area on 15th February, 1918. About this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
time brigades were reduced from four to three
battalions. The 1/8th and 1/9th Liverpool Regiment
and 1/5th Loyal North Lancashire were taken
out of the 55th and sent to the 57th. In the beginning
of 1918 there was difficulty in keeping second
line divisions up to establishment.</p>

<p>When the Lys battle broke out the 55th Division
was put to as severe a test as could be imagined,
and stood it magnificently. The Division was congratulated
in an order by the Commander-in-Chief,
and the terms of his supplementary despatch, dated
15th April, 1918, could not have been more flattering.
It was as follows:</p>

<p class="fs80">
“The 55th Division at Givenchy, 9th-14th April, 1918.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 7em">Headquarters, France, Monday, 1.15 p.m.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“On the morning of the German attack on the
9th April, 1918, the 55th (West Lancashire) Division
(Territorial) was holding a front of about 6000 yards,
extending from the La Bassée Canal to just south of
Richebourg l’Avoué, where its line joined that held
by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>“The enemy’s attack on the southern portion
of this front was delivered by all three regiments
of the 4th Ersatz Division, which was well up to
strength.</p>

<p>“A captured Divisional order issued by the
General Staff of this German Division, and dated
6th April, 1918, shows that its objectives were
‘the ground and the British position in the triangle
formed by Givenchy-Festubert-Gorre.’</p>

<p>“The following passages from this captured
order are of special interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“‘In our attack our three regiments will be
opposed by at most six companies in front and at
most two reserve battalions in Festubert and
Givenchy. One battalion in divisional reserve is
south of the La Bassée Canal, in Le Preol. It will
be prevented by our powerful artillery fire from
taking part in the fight for Festubert and Givenchy.
The troops are elements of the English 55th Division,
which, after being engaged on the Somme,
has suffered heavy losses in Flanders and at
Cambrai, and was described by prisoners in March,
1918, as a division fit to hold a quiet sector, that is
below the average quality.’</p>

<p>“The order containing the passages quoted above
was distributed among all officers and under-officers
of the 4th Ersatz Division down to platoon-commanders,
presumably with a view to encouraging
the troops prior to their attack, and in the belief
that the opposition met with would not be very
serious. If this was his expectation, the enemy
was most signally disappointed.</p>

<p>“Throughout the early part of the morning of
the 9th April, the 55th Division beat off all
attacks in its forward zone, and maintained its line
intact.</p>

<p>“Later, when the German infantry had broken
through the Portuguese positions on its left, the
Division formed a defensive flank facing north-east
on the line Givenchy-Festubert to the neighbourhood
of Le Touret. This line it maintained practically
unchanged until relief, through six days of
almost continual fighting, in the course of which it
beat off repeated German attacks with the heaviest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
losses to the enemy, and took nearly a thousand
prisoners.</p>

<p>“At one time, on the first day of his attack, the
enemy’s troops forced their way into Givenchy
and Festubert. Both villages were shortly afterwards
regained by the 55th Division as the result
of a highly successful counter-attack, in which
several hundred Germans were captured.</p>

<p>“All further attempts on the part of the enemy
to carry these positions broke down before the
resolute defence of the 55th Division. Though he
succeeded on the 11th April in entering a post north
of Festubert, he was thrown out again by a counter-attack,
and on the night of the 12th April the 55th
Division improved its position in this neighbourhood,
capturing a German post and taking several
prisoners.</p>

<p>“Next day, during the afternoon, the enemy
heavily bombarded the whole front held by the
Division between Gorre and the Lawe Canal, and
subsequently attacked in strength. He was once
more repulsed with heavy loss by the most gallant
and successful defence of a division which he had
been pleased to describe as consisting of second-class
troops.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fine conduct of the Division was again referred
to in the despatch of 20th July, 1918, which deals
with the Lys battle, paragraph 51. It was there
stated that “Throughout the remainder of the day,
9th April, the 55th Division maintained its positions
against all assaults, and by successful counter-attacks
captured over 750 prisoners. The success
of this most gallant defence, the importance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
which it would be hard to over-estimate, was due
in great measure to the courage and determination
displayed by our advance posts. These held out
with the utmost resolution though surrounded,
pinning to the ground those parties of the enemy
who had penetrated our defences, and preventing
them from developing their attack. Among the
many gallant deeds recorded of them, one instance
is known of a machine gun which was kept in action
although the German infantry had entered the rear
compartment of the ‘pill-box’ from which it was
firing, the gun team holding up the enemy by
revolver fire from the inner compartment.”</p>

<p>The losses of the Division at Givenchy exceeded
3000.</p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
40, shows that in September there was sharp fighting
in which the 16th, 55th and 19th Divisions
pressed back the enemy and “advanced our line
close to the outskirts of La Bassée.”</p>

<p>During the remainder of September pressure was
kept up by the I. Corps, now in the Fifth Army,
including the 55th Division. In October the enemy
withdrew slowly, and the Division followed closely
on his heels, driving in rearguards and at times
meeting with very stubborn opposition. On 8th
October the III. Corps took control and the same
policy was pursued. The Haute Deule canal was
crossed on the night of 15th-16th October after
a good deal of fighting. On the morning of 11th
November the town of Ath was occupied.</p>

<p>An excellent account of the work of the Division
will be found in <cite>The Story of the 55th (West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
Lancashire) Division</cite>, by the Rev. J. O. Coop, D.S.O.,
T.D., Liverpool, 1919.</p>

<p>The 1/5th Royal Lancaster Regiment, 1/10th
Liverpool Regiment, and 1/5th South Lancashire
Regiment were chosen for the Armies of Occupation.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">1ST</span> LONDON. <span class="smcap">First Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The 56th Division does not seem to have been
mentioned as a unit till 1916; the reason was that
its individual battalions went to France early in
the war, being attached to Regular divisions and,
as in the case of the 55th, many months elapsed
before the Division was concentrated.</p>

<p>Unofficial historians over and over again refer to
the splendid service performed by battalions of the
56th during the critical first winter of the war, and
in the second awful struggle at Ypres in April and
May 1915. Before the Division was constituted as
a unit in France many of these battalions had few
of their original members left. Sir A. Conan Doyle
mentions that on 12th May, 1915, before the close
of the battle, the 5th London had only 200 men.</p>

<p>In Sir John French’s despatch of 20th November,
1914, dealing with the First Battle of Ypres, 11th
October to 12th November, he said, paragraph 10:
“In the period covered by this despatch Territorial
troops have been used for the first time in
the Army under my command,” and he mentioned
“the London Scottish and Queen’s Westminster battalions”
as among the units actually engaged; both
were afterwards in the 56th Division. “The conduct
and bearing of these units under fire, and the efficient
manner in which they carried out the various duties
assigned to them, have imbued me with the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
hope as to the value and help of Territorial troops
generally.” Events were to prove these hopes well-founded.</p>

<p>Officers and men of the 5th City of London
Regiment and of the 9th, 13th and 14th County of
London Regiment were mentioned in the despatch
of 14th January, 1915, for good work in the fighting
before that date, and in the despatch of 31st May,
1915, many officers and men of the 3rd, 4th and 5th
City of London and of the 9th, 12th, 13th, 14th and
16th County of London, gained mention; all these
battalions were afterwards in the 56th Division.</p>

<p>In Sir John French’s despatch of 15th June,
1915, paragraph 4, regarding “The Battles of Ypres,
1915,” which commenced on the 22nd April of that
year with the great “gas attack,” he mentioned
two battalions of the 56th Division. As to the fighting
on 8th May, quoting Sir Herbert Plumer, “A
counter-attack was launched at 3.30 p.m.” “The
12th London Regiment, on the left, succeeded, at
great cost, in reaching the original trench line, and
did considerable execution with their machine gun.”
As to the 13th May, when another serious German
attack was made “after the heaviest bombardment
yet experienced, ... the 5th London Regiment,
despite very heavy casualties, maintained their
position unfalteringly.”</p>

<p>The Division, like other first line Territorial
divisions, had their full share of fighting in the big
battles of 1916 and 1917.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 23rd December,
1916, paragraph 8 (Dent’s edition), shows that the
56th along with the 46th Division made the subsidiary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
attack at Gommecourt, north of the Somme,
on 1st July. They were then in the Third Army,
VII. Corps. (See 46th Division.)</p>

<p>The 56th was afterwards sent to the XIV. Corps,
Fourth Army, and took part in the successful attack
of 9th September, now officially the “Battle of
Ginchy.” Paragraph 23: “At Ginchy and to the
north of Leuze Wood it met with almost immediate
success. On the right (56th Division) the enemy’s
line was seized over a front of more than 1000 yards.”
Paragraphs 27 and 28 deal with another successful
attack on 15th September and following days, officially
the “Battle of Flers-Courcelette,” when the
Division was again employed.</p>

<p>While the French worked up the south side of
Combles, the 56th encompassed it from the north
and, on 26th September, met their Allies in the
town. Down to the close of the Somme battles,
the Division, “hard-worked and splendid,” Sir A.
Conan Doyle describes them, “were doing fine work
always on the extreme right.”</p>

<p>The fighting between 25th and 28th September
has been designated the “Battle of Morval,” and
that between 1st and 18th October, the “Battle
of the Transloy Ridges.”</p>

<p>The despatch of 25th December, 1917, paragraph
13 (Dent’s edition), shows that the 56th, again in
the VII. Corps, Third Army, took part in the Battle
of Arras which opened on 9th April, 1917. Paragraph
14: “By 12 noon the 12th Division had
captured Observation Ridge and, with the exception
of Railway Triangle, the whole of our second
objectives were in our possession from south of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Neuville Vitasse, stormed by London Territorials
(56th Division), to north of La Folie Farm.” A large
number of prisoners were taken. The 56th had an
extremely difficult task and met with stubborn
resistance. As was to be expected, their losses were
considerable.</p>

<p>Paragraph 17: “On 12th April our attacks on
Héninel and Wancourt were renewed, and our
troops (21st and 56th Divisions) succeeded in carrying
both villages, as well as in completing the
capture of the Hindenburg line for some 2000
yards south of the Cojeul river.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 27: On 11th May “London troops
(56th Division) captured Cavalry Farm.”</p>

<p>In addition to the actions mentioned in these
extracts, the Division was engaged throughout the
Arras operations on many other occasions, notably
on 13th and 14th April and on 3rd May, when one
brigade made an excellent advance. Throughout
the battles of Arras the work of the 56th was of
outstanding merit.</p>

<p>The fighting between 9th and 14th April is now
the “First Battle of the Scarpe, 1917,” and that
on 3rd and 4th May the “Third Battle of the
Scarpe, 1917.”</p>

<p>The Division was employed on 16th August,
1917, in the second big attack in the Third Battle
of Ypres, now “The Battles of Ypres, 1917.” The
action of 16th August is now designated the
“Battle of Langemarck.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 46 of the same despatch: “On the right
of the British attack the enemy again developed
the main strength of his resistance. At the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
a day of very heavy fighting, except for small gains
of ground on the western edge of Glencorse Wood
and north of Westhoek by the 56th Division (Major-General
F. A. Dudgeon) and the 8th Division the
situation south of St. Julien remained unchanged.”</p>

<p>The losses of the Division on the 16th August
were extremely heavy. In the Ypres battle they were
in the II. Corps.</p>

<p>When the Cambrai battle commenced on 20th
November the 56th were not in the main assault
on the 20th but kept up a feint or subsidiary attack
on that date.</p>

<p>In the despatch of Sir Douglas Haig, dated 20th
February, 1918, as to the “Battle of Cambrai,
1917,” paragraph 6, he said that the 22nd November
1917 was spent in organising the ground which had
been captured on the 20th and 21st, carrying out
reliefs, etc. “Meanwhile, early in the night of the
22nd November, a battalion of the Queen’s Westminsters
(16th London), 56th Division, Major-General
F. A. Dudgeon, stormed a commanding
tactical point in the Hindenburg line, west of
Mœuvres, known as Tadpole Copse, the possession
of which would be of value in connection with the
left flank of the Bourlon position when the latter
had been secured.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 7 deals with the renewal of the British
attack on 23rd November. “Throughout this day
also the 36th Division and troops of the 56th (London)
Division (T.) were engaged in stubborn fighting in
the neighbourhood of Mœuvres and Tadpole Copse
and made some progress.”</p>

<p>On the 27th there was again heavy fighting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
“During the afternoon the enemy also attacked our
positions at Tadpole Copse but was repulsed.”</p>

<p>Paragraphs 10-11 deal with the great German
counter-attack of 30th November, and a quotation
in which the 47th and 56th Divisions are both said
to have greatly distinguished themselves, is given
under the former. The fine conduct of both divisions
could not have been surpassed.</p>

<p>In Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 20th July,
1918, he gives a detailed account of the German
attack in the Cambrai-St. Quentin district which
commenced on 21st March, and compelled the retreat
of the Fifth Army, and the partial withdrawal of
the Third.</p>

<p>At paragraph 45 he describes the attack on the
Arras front, an extension to the north of the earlier
attacks. “Meanwhile, between 7 and 8 a.m. on the
morning of March 28th, fighting of the utmost
intensity had broken out north of the Somme
from Puisieux to north-east of Arras. Finding
himself checked on the northern flank of his attack
the enemy on this day made a determined effort to
obtain greater freedom for the development of his
offensive, and struck in great force along the valley
of the Scarpe at Arras.”... “After a bombardment
of great violence, three fresh German divisions
advanced to the assault along the north bank of
the Scarpe river against the positions held by the
4th and 56th British Divisions under the command
respectively of Major-General T. G. Matheson and
Major-General F. A. Dudgeon, and were supported
in their attack by the two German divisions already
in line.”... “His troops were everywhere stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
and thrown back with the heaviest loss before
our battle positions.” “A second attack late
in the afternoon north of the Scarpe, after a further
period of bombardment, was also repulsed at all
points. At the end of the day our battle positions
astride the Scarpe were intact on the whole front
of the attack, and in the evening successful counter-attacks
enabled us to push out a new outpost line
in front of them. Meanwhile the surviving garrisons
of our original outpost line, whose most gallant
resistance had played so large a part in breaking
up the enemy’s attack, had fought their way back
through the enemy.”</p>

<p>His defeat on the 28th weakened the enemy’s
offensive and it eventually closed a few days later.
The stand made by the Division, on the flank of
the attack, where it was strongly pressed, was not
excelled by the performance of any other unit
during the March battle, and greatly contributed
to the cessation of the German effort. The fighting
on 28th March is now the “First Battle of Arras,
1918.” The Division was at that time in the XIII.
Corps, First Army (see paragraph 45 of the despatch).
It was the only division of the First Army engaged
on the 28th.</p>

<p>In his telegraphic despatch of 13th September,
1918, as to the good work of various divisions in the
early days of the last British offensive, under the
heading 56th Division, Sir Douglas Haig said:
“The 56th Division, which on March 28th assisted
in the repulse of the German attack north of the
Scarpe, on August 23rd attacked successfully, with
the 52nd Division, at Boyelles and Hénin-sur-Cojeul.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
These two divisions met with very vigorous
resistance about Croisilles and the important feature
known as Hénin Hill to the north of it, but captured
both places. On August 29th by a daring operation
the 56th Division and the 57th Division captured
Bullecourt and Hendicourt-lez-Cagnicourt. The
possession of both villages was fiercely disputed,
but on September 1st the 52nd and 57th Divisions
secured firm hold of them and took Riencourt-lez-Cagnicourt.
Also on September 2nd the 52nd and
57th Divisions continued the attack, with the 63rd
Division, and captured Quéant, Pronville and Fontaine-lez-Croisilles.”</p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, shows that
the 56th Division was on 23rd August in the VI.
Corps, Third Army. These events are again referred
to in paragraphs 22, 23 and 28.</p>

<p>Paragraph 22 as to 24th August states: “On
the left troops of the 56th Division, Major-General
Sir C. P. A. Hull, had heavy fighting about Croisilles
and on the high ground north-west of that village
known as Hénin Hill.”</p>

<p>About 25th August the XVII. Corps was formed
with the 52nd, 56th, and 57th Divisions, and later
the 63rd. In the beginning of September the 56th
became part of the XXII. Corps, First Army. Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, vol. vi. p. 133, puts the
losses of the Division between 27th and 31st
August at 2723 and the prisoners they took at
over 1000.</p>

<p>In paragraph 23 as to 29th August, Sir Douglas
Haig said: “To the north of Bapaume a gallant
thrust by the 56th and 57th Divisions penetrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
the enemy’s position as far as Riencourt-lez-Cagnicourt.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 35: “The Battle of Cambrai and the
Hindenburg Line, 27th September-5th October,”
states: “On the extreme left the 56th Division of
the XXII. Corps” (on 27th September) crossed the
canal and, having cleared Sauchy Lestrée and
Sauchy Cauchy, moved northwards to Palluel.</p>

<p>About 11th and 12th October the Division was
employed in attacks; it took Fresnes and moved
forward, overcoming various obstacles.</p>

<p>The various actions between August and October
are now officially defined as follows: 21st-23rd
August, the Battle of Albert, 1918; 26th-30th
August, Battle of the Scarpe, 1918; 2nd-3rd September,
Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant Line; 27th
September-1st October, Battle of the Canal du
Nord; 8th-12th October, Battle of Cambrai, 1918,
with Pursuit to Selle.</p>

<p>Paragraph 50 describes “The Battle of the
Sambre, 1st-11th November.” Regarding the 4th-6th
November: “On the front of the First Army,
the XXII. Corps and the Canadian Corps advanced
against little opposition except on their right.
Here the 11th and 56th Divisions, having crossed
the Aunelle river and captured the villages of Le
Triez, Sebourg and Sebourg Quiaux, were counter-attacked
on the high ground east of the Aunelle
and pressed back slightly.”</p>

<p>On the 6th the Division after heavy fighting
gained its objectives. The advance continued
between 7th November and the 11th, Armistice Day.</p>

<p>It will have been observed that all references<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
to the work of the Division were invariably of a
laudatory character.</p>

<p>The 1/10th and 1/11th County of London
Regiment, originally belonging to the 56th, served
with the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Suvla
Bay, Gallipoli, and in Palestine, their places being
taken by the 1/7th and 1/8th Middlesex from the
44th (Home Counties) Division.</p>

<p>The 1/6th City of London Regiment, originally
belonging to the 56th, but which served with the
47th, the 1/9th County of London Regiment of the
56th and the 1/7th Middlesex, which belonged to
the 44th, but served with the 56th, were selected
for the Army of the Rhine. The 1/10th County
of London Regiment, which, as above stated, served
with the 54th, was chosen for the Army of Occupation,
Egypt.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Division went to France in February, 1917,
and was employed in the Bailleul-Armentières-Ypres
area during the greater part of 1917, and for
the first four months of 1918.</p>

<p>A quotation, in which West Lancashire Territorials
are mentioned as taking part in an advance in “The
Battles of Ypres, 1917,” on 16th August, 1917, has
been given under the 48th Division. The number
of the West Lancashire Division is not given in the
<cite>Gazette</cite> or in Messrs. Dent’s edition of <cite>Sir Douglas
Haig’s Despatches</cite>. It seems to be the case that
the infantry of the 55th or 57th was not present
on that date. The reference may apply to some
West Lancashire Artillery.</p>

<p>The 57th did attack as part of the XIV. Corps
on 26th October, the “Second Battle of Passchendaele,”
see 50th Division. Ground was gained, but
the conditions were most difficult and the casualties
of the 57th were very heavy.</p>

<p>Early in May 1918 the 57th took over from the
42nd in the Bucquoy area, south of Arras.</p>

<p>In August one brigade of the 57th was, for a
time, attached to the 51st Division on the Scarpe
and took part in a preliminary attack on the
19th. During that month the XVII. Corps, which
embraced the 52nd, 56th, 57th, and later the 63rd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
Divisions, took over in that area, coming in between
the VI. Corps and the Canadians.</p>

<p>The XVII. Corps, as part of the Third Army,
attacked on the 25th August (see 52nd and 56th),
and the 57th entered the front line on the night of
the 27th. It had very severe fighting between
28th August and 2nd September and did well, as
appears from the extracts referred to below.</p>

<p>In the telegraphic despatch of 13th September,
1918, as to the work of certain divisions, a quotation
from which has already been given under the 56th,
the 57th was mentioned for its fine services about
Bullecourt and there is also given under the 56th
a quotation from the despatch of 21st December,
1918, paragraph 23, which applies to both divisions.</p>

<p>Paragraph 28 of the latter despatch deals with
the storming of the Drocourt-Quéant line, 2nd
September, 1918. “This gallant feat of arms was
carried out by,” among other troops, “the XVII.
Corps of the Third Army employing the 52nd,
57th, and 63rd Divisions.” A quotation as to the
battle on that date has been given under the 52nd.
In the afternoon there was hard fighting but the
enemy’s opposition was overcome by nightfall
“and the 57th Division, swinging to the right, was
threatening the villages of Quéant and Pronville
from the north.” During the night and following
day the enemy rapidly retreated.</p>

<p>The fighting in the area in which the XVII.
Corps was then operating, 26th-30th August, is
now the “Battle of the Scarpe, 1918,” and that
on 2nd-3rd September, the “Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant
Line.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>In the big and fiercely contested battle commencing
on 27th September the XVII. Corps had
again to make an effort almost, if not quite, as great
as that which broke the Quéant line on 2nd September,
and nothing could have been finer than the
work of the 52nd, 57th, and 63rd Divisions on this
second occasion. The position of the enemy was
of immense strength and a wide and deep canal was
among the obstacles to be overcome in the advance
of the Corps. The fighting on the front of the XVII.
Corps lasted, almost without intermission, from 27th
September to 1st October. This is now designated
the “Battle of the Canal du Nord.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 35 of the despatch of 21st December,
1918, dealing with “the Battle of Cambrai and the
Hindenburg Line, 27th September-5th October,”
states: “In the centre the 52nd Division passing its
troops across the canal by bridgeheads previously
established by the 57th Division, on the opening of
the assault carried the German lines east of the
canal,” etc., but in Messrs. Dent’s edition, p. 281,
there is the following note: “This is incorrect.
There were no bridgeheads at this time and the
crossings were forced by the 52nd Division at the
opening of their attack.”</p>

<p>The despatch proceeds: “As soon as the line of
the canal had been secured our engineer troops
commenced the construction of bridges, completing
their task with remarkable speed, and working
with great gallantry under the fire of the German
guns. Greatly assisted by their efforts our advance
continued. Obstinate resistance was met with at
Graincourt, and it was not until late in the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
that the village was finally surrounded and captured
by the 63rd Division. The 57th Division
(Major-General R. W. R. Barnes) meanwhile had
passed through and carried the line forward east of
Anneux to Fontaine-Notre-Dame.”</p>

<p>In paragraph 42, “The Second Battle of Le
Cateau, 8th-12th October,” now officially designated
the “Battle of Cambrai, 1918,” the despatch
shows that on 8th October the Third and Fourth
Armies attacked and very heavy fighting ensued.
“On the extreme left the 57th Division made progress
in the southern outskirts of Cambrai....
During the following night the Canadian Corps
captured Ramillies and crossed the Scheldt canal
at Pont d’Aire. Canadian patrols entered Cambrai
from the north and joined hands with patrols of
the 57th Division working through the southern
portion of the town.” Next day, “Cambrai was in
our hands and our troops were three miles to the
east of the town.” Progress continued on the 10th.
Shortly after this the 57th was taken out of the
XVII. Corps and entered the XI. Corps, Fifth
Army.</p>

<p>The operations referred to above turned the defences
of Lille from the south, and paragraph 45,
dealing with “The Evacuation of Lille,” states that
the 57th and 59th Divisions were by the evening
of 17th October “on the outskirts of Lille.” These
divisions were then in the XI. Corps.</p>

<p>Thereafter the work of the 57th Division was less
arduous; the fighting in the area of the Fifth Army
was not so severe as it had been on the fronts of the
Third and Fourth Armies farther south.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="58TH_1ST_LONDON_DIVISION"><span class="allsmcap">58TH</span> (<span class="allsmcap">1ST</span> LONDON) DIVISION<br>
<span class="smcap">Second Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Division went to France in January 1917. In
March and April 1917, Gough’s Fifth Army, which
contained the 7th, 58th and 62nd Divisions and
Australians, was pressing the enemy towards the
Hindenburg line, south of Bullecourt. In April
as that line was approached the resistance became
stronger. While the Arras battle was proceeding
on the left (see 56th Division) the Fifth Army had
some severe struggles, in the course of which the
line at Bullecourt was pierced. In these actions
the Australians did splendid work and they were
nobly backed up by the three British divisions.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 25th December,
1917, paragraph 27 (Dent’s edition), shows that on
7th May, 1917, towards the close of the Arras battle,
the 7th Division “gained a footing in the south-east
corner of Bullecourt. Thereafter gradual progress
was made in face of the most obstinate resistance
and on the 17th May, London and West Riding
Territorials (58th and 62nd Divisions) completed the
capture of the village.” The Division remained in
the southern area for some months. On 8th July it
took over from the 42nd in the Havrincourt sector.</p>

<p>The Division was employed in the Third Battle of
Ypres as part of the XVIII. Corps, which it joined
early in August.</p>

<p>Paragraph 50 of the same despatch deals with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the “most successful” assault which was launched
during that battle on 20th September, 1917. “North
of the Zonnebeke-Langemarck road London and
Highland Territorials (58th and 51st Divisions) gained
the whole of their objectives by midday, though stiff
fighting took place for a number of farms and strong
places.” The official designation of this action is now
the “Battle of Menin Road Ridge.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 52, as to the attack on 26th September:
“The assault was delivered at 5.50 a.m. and, after
hard and prolonged fighting in which over 1600
prisoners were taken by us, achieved a success as
striking as that of the 20th September.” Australian
troops carried the remainder of Polygon Wood,
etc., on their left the 3rd Division took Zonnebeke.
“North Midland and London Territorial battalions
(59th Division, Major-General C. F. Romer, and
58th Division) captured a long line of hostile strong
points on both sides of the Wieltje-Gravenstafel
road.” This is now the “Battle of Polygon Wood.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 59, as to the assault on the Passchendaele
Ridge on 26th October, the “Second Battle
of Passchendaele”: “On the left of the Canadians
the Royal Naval Division and battalions of London
Territorials (58th Division, Major-General A. B. E.
Cator) also advanced and, in spite of immense difficulties
from marsh and floods in the more low-lying
ground, made progress.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 60, as to the attack on 30th October
when the Canadians continued their advance along
the ridge: “Further north battalions of the same
London and Naval Divisions (58th and 63rd) that
had taken part in the attack on 26th October again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
made progress wherever it was possible to find a way
across the swamps. The almost impassable nature
of the ground in this area, however, made movement
practically impossible, and it was only on the
main ridge that much could be effected.”</p>

<p>The fine reputation of the Division was enhanced,
not only by the fighting qualities displayed in these
and other actions, but by the soldierly spirit with
which they endured the horrors of the salient
throughout an unusually long spell of service there.</p>

<p>When the German offensive opened on 21st
March, 1918, the 58th Division was in the III. Corps,
Fifth Army; the other divisions of that Corps on
the 21st being the 14th on the left and the 18th
in the centre. The 58th on the right was the flank
unit of the British Armies. The Oise above La
Fère, opposite the ground held by the left brigade of
the 58th, flows from north to south and thereafter
from east to west. One brigade, the 173rd, was on
the west bank above the bend while the others held
a line from the south bank to Barisis, four miles
south of the river. The two latter brigades were not
seriously involved on the 21st. Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle gives a detailed account of the battle on the
III. Corps front. At p. 111, vol. v. he states that
the 173rd Brigade, “which filled the space between
Travecy on the left, and the Oise upon the right,
had the 2/1st Londons in the forward zone, the
2/4th Londons in the battle zone opposite La Fère
and the 2/3rd Londons in the rear zone upon the
Crozat Canal. The single battalion in front was
attacked by the impossible odds of three German
divisions but held out for a long time with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
constancy.” The battalion was overwhelmed but
fought to the end. The enemy stormed forward
to the battle zone but were vigorously opposed
by the 4th Battalion aided by some sappers and
pioneers. This force held up the attack for a time
but were pressed back. “By 5 a.m. on the 22nd
all troops were across, and the bridges destroyed.
The 2/4th Londons succeeded in removing all their
stores and munitions, and their remarkable achievement
in holding the high ground of La Fère against
ten times their numbers for as many hours, during
which they inflicted very heavy losses upon their
assailants, and repulsed six separate attacks, was
among the outstanding military feats of that
difficult day.”</p>

<p>The 18th Division made a wonderfully fine and
successful stand, but a break-through occurred on
the front of the 14th Division.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig in his despatch of 20th July,
1918, paragraph 10, gives the dispositions of the
various Corps on the Fifth Army front and states
that “Over ten miles of this front between Amigny
Rouy and Alaincourt were protected by the marshes
of the Oise river and canal, and were therefore
held more lightly than the remainder of the line;
but on the whole front of this Army the number of
divisions in line only allowed of an average of one
division to some 6750 yards of front.”</p>

<p>On the III. Corps front the extent of ground held
was about 30,000 yards by two divisions and a
brigade of a third. Their line was certainly opposite
the marsh area but, as pointed out in paragraph 15
of the despatch, “Assisted by the long spell of dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
weather hostile infantry had crossed the river and
canal north of La Fère, and, south of St. Quentin,
had penetrated into the battle zone between Essigny
and Benay.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 14 shows that during the morning of
the 21st, “the enemy had penetrated our front line
opposite La Fère.” This was in the area of the 58th,
see map opposite p. 186 of Messrs. Dent’s edition.</p>

<p>Paragraph 16 shows that Fargnier and Quessy
were lost during the afternoon and evening of
the 21st.</p>

<p>Paragraph 17 states that on the evening of the
21st the Fifth Army Commander decided to “withdraw
the divisions of that Corps (the III.) behind
the Crozat Canal.... These different withdrawals
were carried out successfully during the
night.... Instances of great bravery occurred
in the destruction of the bridges.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 18: “On the morning of the 22nd
March the ground was again enveloped in thick
mist, under cover of which the enemy renewed his
attacks in great strength all along the line. Fighting
was again very heavy, and short-range fire from
guns, rifles and machine-guns caused enormous
losses to the enemy’s troops. The weight of his
attack, however, combined with the impossibility
of observing beforehand and engaging with artillery
the massing of his troops, enabled him to press
forward.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 19: “In the south the enemy advanced
during the morning as far as the line of the canal
at Jussy” (area of 18th Division), “and a fierce
struggle commenced for the passage of the canal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
his troops bringing up trench mortars and machine
guns, and endeavouring to cross on rafts under
cover of their fire. At 1 p.m. he succeeded in
effecting a crossing at Quessy, and made progress
during the afternoon in the direction of Vouel.
His further advance in this sector, however, was
delayed by the gallant resistance of troops of the
58th Division, under command of Major-General
A. B. E. Cator, at Tergnier, and it was not until
evening, after many costly attempts and much
sanguinary fighting, that the enemy gained possession
of this village.”</p>

<p>On 23rd March the 173rd Brigade had again very
heavy fighting about Noureuil. The despatch,
paragraph 25, refers to “the most resolute resistance
offered to the enemy’s advance” by the III. Corps
and “many gallant actions performed.” The
fighting 21st to 23rd March is now the “Battle
of St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>On the 24th the III. Corps, and certain French
troops which had come to its aid, were pushed back
to the south and west of Chauny by the huge forces
of the enemy (see paragraph 32). That night the
remnants of the 173rd brigade were ordered to
rejoin the remainder of the Division on the south
side of the Oise.</p>

<p>While the British were being pushed back on the
north bank, the 174th and 175th Brigades kept
extending to their left along the south bank and
held the river line, until their frontage was about
twelve miles. This task was of absolutely vital
importance. Several hostile attempts to cross were
defeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Sparrow in his <cite>Fifth Army</cite> does not give details
regarding the work of the 58th, but on p. 85 he speaks
of their resistance at Tergnier on the 22nd, and in
a note there occurs this sentence: “What could
have been more valuable to the Allied cause than
was this prolonged resistance at a most critical
time and place?” On p. 283 there is another note
which mentions that the right of the Division was
not attacked, “their left had fought magnificently.”</p>

<p>The Division was taken north early in April,
and was immediately to the south of Villers Bretonneux
when that village was captured by the enemy
on 24th April. They were heavily engaged on that
and the two succeeding days during which the
village and certain other positions were recaptured.
The Division again had serious losses.</p>

<p>In the telegraphic despatch of 13th September,
1918, as to the work of various divisions, Sir Douglas
Haig said: “The 58th Division, which held the
right of the British line on March 21st, attacked
on August 8th, north of the Somme, and captured
Sailly Laurette. In five days of severe fighting the
Division captured many prisoners and guns, and
performed very gallant service on the left flank of
our advance south of the Somme. On the 24th
August it again attacked in the sector north of the
Somme, and once more did gallant work, overcoming
strong hostile resistance at Maricourt and
Marrières Wood.”</p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, shows,
paragraph 16, that the 58th was in the III. Corps,
Fourth Army, when it was employed in the attack
on 8th August. That date and succeeding days are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
dealt with in paragraphs 15 to 18 of the written
despatch. In paragraph 15 Sir Douglas Haig remarked
that: “A strong local attack launched by
the enemy on the 6th August, south of Morlancourt,
led to severe fighting, and undoubtedly rendered
the task of the III. Corps more difficult.”</p>

<p>On the 8th the 58th took Sailly Laurette, but
were held up at Chipilly Spur. With some assistance
this was cleared on the 9th. On the 10th a
further advance was made by the III. Corps. The
fighting 8th-11th August is now designated “The
Battle of Amiens.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 21 deals with the attack by the III.
Corps on 22nd August, the 47th, 12th and 18th
of that Corps and the 3rd Australian and 38th
Divisions being employed in the first line of attacking
troops. The 58th reinforced the 47th in the
afternoon. Albert was taken and the left of the
Fourth Army brought forward.</p>

<p>Paragraph 22 describes the fighting on 23rd and
24th August when further progress was made.
“Divisions which in the worst days of the March
retreat had proved themselves superior to every
hardship, difficulty and danger, once more rose to
the occasion with the most magnificent spirit;
over the same ground that had witnessed their
stubborn greatness in defence they moved forward
to the attack with a persistent vigour and relentless
determination which neither the extreme difficulty
of the ground, nor the obstinate resistance of the
enemy, could diminish or withstand.”</p>

<p>The fighting 21st-23rd August is now “The Battle
of Albert, 1918.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>On the 24th the 58th had a stiff fight but they
and the 47th secured their objectives.</p>

<p>Paragraph 23 said: “During the next five days
our troops followed up their advantage hotly, and
in spite of increasing resistance from the German
rearguards, realised a further deep advance. The
enemy clung to his positions in the latter stages
of this period with much tenacity. His infantry
delivered many counter-attacks, and the progress
of our troops was only won by hard and determined
fighting.” On 28th August, “the 12th Division and
58th Division (Major-General F. W. Ramsay) captured
Hardecourt and the spur south of it, overcoming
strong resistance.”</p>

<p>On the 25th the 58th were heavily engaged at
Billon Wood which was held strongly. On the 28th
they took Marrières Wood.</p>

<p>Paragraph 24 deals with the fighting for Mont
St. Quentin and the capture of Peronne, in support
of which operations the 58th, 47th and other divisions
attacked on 31st August, and “by successful
fighting on this and the following day, captured
Bouchavesnes, Rancourt and Frégicourt, with several
hundred prisoners.” This is now the “Second
Battle of Bapaume.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 30 described the Battle of Havrincourt
and Epéhy, 12th-18th September, and as to
18th September, the “Battle of Epéhy,” said, “On
the extreme right, and in the left centre about
Epéhy the enemy’s resistance was very determined
and in these sectors troops of the 6th, 12th, 18th
and 58th Divisions had severe fighting. Before
nightfall, however, the last centres of resistance in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Epéhy were reduced, and both in this area and on
our right about Gricourt local actions during the
succeeding days secured for us the remainder of
the positions required for an attack on the main
Hindenburg defences.”</p>

<p>On the 18th September the 58th took Peizières
and made further progress during the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>On 24th September the Division, now weakened
by the heavy tasks it had carried through during
eight weeks’ fighting, left the III. Corps and moved
north to join the First Army. It had no more hard
fighting. In October, headquarters of that Corps
were transferred to the Fifth Army in Flanders
where times were less strenuous.</p>

<p>Major-General Montgomery’s <cite>Story of the Fourth
Army</cite> (Hodder and Stoughton) contains many
flattering references to the work of the Division
in August and September, 1918.</p>

<span class="smcap">Second Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This Division was employed in Ireland at the time
of the Dublin rebellion of April 1916, and, but
for that outbreak, might have gone abroad earlier
than it did. It sailed in February 1917, was taken
to the district east of Amiens and assisted to press
the enemy when he retreated in March of that year.
When the retreat was over they occupied the line
near Havrincourt Wood; at that time they formed
part of the III. Corps, Fourth Army. On 13th April,
the 59th and other troops made an advance when
ground near Gricourt was taken and consolidated.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1917 the Division was in the
Ypres salient, and was employed as part of the V.
Corps about the Wieltje-Gravenstafel road, east
of St. Julien, in the attack of 26th September,
now called the “Battle of Polygon Wood,” a stage
in the Third Battle of Ypres, when, at the cost of
heavy losses various strong points were captured
and the line advanced. A quotation as to this from
the despatch of 25th December, 1917, paragraph 52,
has already been given under the 58th Division, see
also map opposite p. 123 of Messrs. Dent’s edition
of <cite>Sir Douglas Haig’s Despatches</cite>.</p>

<p>The map opposite p. 163 of the same edition
shows that the 59th was at Cantaing, south-west of
Cambrai, when the enemy made their great counter-attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
on 30th November, 1917, but it was not so
severely pressed at that point as on the immediate
left of the Division.</p>

<p>The Division was heavily involved in the great
German offensive—the “Battle of St. Quentin”—which
commenced on 21st March, 1918, and had
very severe losses. The map opposite p. 186 of the
edition above referred to shows that the Division
was occupying the line about Bullecourt in the area
of the Third Army on the 21st and a break-through
took place between Bullecourt and Lagnicourt, the
latter place being in the area of the 6th Division
on the immediate right of the 59th. This part of
the line was evidently one of those selected by the
enemy for a special effort, five divisions attacking
the 59th and a portion of the 34th on its left. Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle gives an excellent account of
this part of the great battle; he states that the 178th
and 176th brigades were in the front line. These
were destroyed but the 177th in support beat off
three very heavy attacks and held out till assistance
came from a division in reserve, the 40th.
The 177th Brigade remained with the 40th Division
and saw further intense fighting during the next few
days—the “First Battle of Bapaume.” Sir Arthur,
vol. v., p. 77, puts the losses of the Division in the
March battle at 5765.</p>

<p>The Division was taken to Flanders and was
involved in the “Battles of the Lys,” in April. Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle, in the volume above referred
to, draws attention to the excellent work of the
178th (Sherwood Forester) Brigade, when attached
to other divisions about 12th to 14th April, but as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
a whole the Division was still suffering from the
grievous losses sustained three weeks before; that
period being obviously insufficient to assimilate the
new drafts which formed such a large proportion of
the total strength.</p>

<p>In consequence of the very heavy casualties it
had suffered in the March battle and on the Lys
the Division was reduced to a cadre basis (see note
to despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph 1,
Dent’s edition), but it recuperated in time to take
part in the final British offensive.</p>

<p>In the despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
45, it is stated that on 17th October, 1918,
the 57th and 59th Divisions of the XI. Corps were
on the outskirts of Lille. On the 18th Lille “was
clear of the enemy,” and our line was carried far
to the east. “Thereafter our troops pressed forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>steadily.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Second Line</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The 60th Division went to France in June 1916.
Their first experience at the front was in the Arras
district. They were there initiated in trench warfare
by the 51st Division, before the latter moved
south to take part in the great conflict on the
Somme.</p>

<p>After about six months in the line on the Western
Front the 60th were, in January 1917, sent to
Salonika. There they saw some hard fighting in
May. In June they joined the Egyptian Expeditionary
Force for service in Palestine. In that
country, as will be seen from the extracts given
below, they earned great distinction.</p>

<p>Sir E. Allenby’s despatch of 16th December, 1917,
recounting the operations which culminated in the
surrender of Jerusalem, shows that the Division
bore a most important and honourable share of the
heavy task that fell to his troops.</p>

<p>The attack was to commence with the capture
of Beersheba, situated on the eastern or left flank
of the Turkish position, on 31st October, 1917.
The despatch says, paragraph 8: “As a preliminary
to the main attack, in order to enable field guns to
be brought within effective range for wire-cutting,
the enemy’s advanced works at 1070 were to be
taken. This was successfully accomplished at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
8.45 a.m., after a short preliminary bombardment
by London troops, with small loss, 90 prisoners
being taken.... The final assault was ordered for
12.15 p.m.; it was successful all along the front
attacked.”</p>

<p>Beersheba was taken at 7 p.m. on the 31st, the
Australian Light Horse and Yeomanry doing very
well. The despatch states: “The Turks at Beersheba
were undoubtedly taken completely by surprise,
a surprise from which the dash of London
troops and Yeomanry, finely supported by their
artillery, never gave them time to recover. The
charge by the Australian Light Horse completed
their defeat.” About 2000 prisoners and 13 guns
were taken and 500 Turkish corpses buried. The
enemy’s left flank was laid bare.</p>

<p>Paragraph 11: On 6th November the Kauwukah
system of trenches was attacked. Yeomanry first
stormed the works on the left; “soon after noon
the London and Irish troops commenced their
attack. It was completely successful in capturing
all its objectives and the whole of the Rushdi
system in addition.... This attack was a fine
performance, the troops advancing eight or nine
miles during the day and capturing a series of very
strong works covering a front of about seven miles,
the greater part of which had been held and
strengthened by the enemy for over six months.
Some 600 prisoners and some guns and machine
guns were captured. Our casualties were comparatively
slight.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 12: On the 7th November “the
London troops, after a severe engagement at Tel el<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Sheria, which they captured by a bayonet charge,
at 4 a.m. on the 7th, subsequently repulsing several
counter-attacks, pushed forward their line about a
mile to the north.” The operations of 27th October
to 7th November are now the “Third Battle of
Gaza.”</p>

<p>For some weeks the strain on the troops was very
great, much heavy marching on a short supply of
water having to be undertaken in addition to
constant fighting, which during the last half of
November became much more intense. Aided
by reinforcements and by the mountainous nature
of the country the enemy put up a great effort
to bring the advance to a standstill, but in this he
failed.</p>

<p>The assault on the positions defending Jerusalem
was fixed for 8th December, the 60th being again
employed. The despatch draws attention to “the
mere physical difficulties of the advance across steep
and rocky hillsides and deep valleys,” artillery
support being difficult, indeed sometimes impossible,
while “the opposition encountered was considerable.”
The weather was most unfavourable,
rain falling heavily on the 7th and three following
days.</p>

<p>The first objectives were carried soon after dawn
and the troops pressed on. “By about noon London
troops had already advanced over two miles, and
were swinging north-east to gain the Nablus-Jerusalem
road,” “throwing back their right to form
a defensive flank, facing east towards Jerusalem,
from the western outskirts of which considerable
rifle and artillery fire was being experienced....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
By nightfall ... all the enemy’s prepared defences
west and north-west of Jerusalem had been captured....
The London troops and Yeomanry had displayed
great endurance in difficult conditions. The
London troops, especially, after a night march in
heavy rain to reach their positions of deployment,
had made an advance of three to four miles in
difficult hills in the face of stubborn opposition.”</p>

<p>On the 9th the advance was resumed, the London
troops and Yeomanry driving back rearguards.
At noon the city was surrendered. The Army had
taken over 12,000 prisoners and 100 guns between
31st October and 9th December. (See also under
52nd, 53rd and 54th Divisions.)</p>

<p>Sir E. Allenby’s despatch of 18th September,
1918, shows that after the surrender of Jerusalem,
he desired to drive back the enemy further from its
precincts.</p>

<p>Paragraph 5: While the XX. Corps, which
included the 53rd and 60th Divisions, was making
preparations to do this the Turks attacked
during the night of 26th-27th December. “By
1.30 a.m. the 60th Division was engaged on its
whole front.</p>

<p>“Between 1.30 a.m. and 8 a.m. on the 27th the
outposts of the 60th Division on the ridge north of
Beit Hanninah repelled four determined attacks,
but the heaviest fighting took place to the east of
the Jerusalem-Nablus road. Repeated attacks
were made against Tel el Ful; a conspicuous hill
from which Jerusalem and the intervening ground
can be overlooked. The attacks were made by
picked bodies of troops and were pressed with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
determination. At only one point did the enemy
succeed in reaching the main line of defence. He
was driven out at once by the local reserves. In
all these attacks he lost heavily.”</p>

<p>After a lull the enemy attacked the front of
the 60th Division at 12.55 p.m. “in unexpected
strength,” but again “local counter-attacks were
successful in restoring the line—this proved to be
the final effort.”</p>

<p>On the 28th December, General Allenby ordered
an advance. The battle was of a very obstinate
character and lasted into the evening of the 29th.
On the 28th the 60th captured several strong positions
by 1 p.m., further positions by 5.30 p.m. and
continued their advance till 9.15 p.m. On the 29th
they resumed their forward movement, meeting
heavy rifle and machine-gun fire near Bireh. About
4.15 p.m., “the left of the attack stormed the
Tahuneh ridge.” “Simultaneously with this attack
the right of the 60th Division had stormed Shab
Saleh in face of heavy machine-gun fire; subsequently
capturing the ridge east of Bireh. At
9 p.m. the advance was continued.”</p>

<p>“The Turkish attempt to recapture Jerusalem had
thus ended in crushing defeat. He had employed
fresh troops who had not participated in the recent
retreat from Beersheba and Gaza and had escaped
its demoralising effects. The determination and
gallantry with which his attack was carried out
only served to increase his losses.”</p>

<p>Another quotation as to this battle has been given
under the 53rd Division, which was also in the XX.
Corps. The operations 17th-24th November, 1917,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
are now the “Battle of Nebi Samwil,” and those
26th to 30th December, the “Defence of Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the despatch deal with
the advance to and capture of Jericho and give a
detailed description of the immense difficulties
which the troops had to surmount.</p>

<p>“The 60th Division had taken over the line east
of Jerusalem some time previously. Opposed to it
were some 5000 rifles, while to the north another 2000
rifles were in a position from which to act against
the left flank of the 60th Division as it advanced.</p>

<p>“The chief obstacle to the advance lay in the
difficulty of the ground rather than any opposition
the enemy might offer.”</p>

<p>Between the line of the 60th and their objectives
lay a succession of ridges some of which were
precipitous.</p>

<p>The advance on Jericho began on 19th February,
1918. On that day the Division captured several
strong positions “in face of considerable opposition.”</p>

<p>That night the enemy attacked and was repulsed
“after a sharp struggle.”</p>

<p>On the 20th further positions were taken, “the
enemy resisting with stubbornness.... The right
brigade met with great opposition. Moreover, the
ground over which the attack had to take place
proved the most rugged and difficult yet met with
in this country.... The left brigade advanced four
miles over difficult country, the enemy fighting a
rearguard action from ridge to ridge.”</p>

<p>By the evening of the 20th “the 60th Division
had reached a line four miles west of the cliffs
overlooking Jericho.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>On the 21st the advance was resumed, the Division
reaching a line which overlooked Jericho. At
8.20 a.m. mounted troops rode into the town.</p>

<p>Paragraph 8 describes a further advance, 8th to
12th March, in which the XX. Corps “had to drive
the enemy from ridge to ridge.” On the 9th the
right brigade of the 60th Division, which had crossed
the Wadi el Auja, north of Jericho, in the dark,
and “had subsequently met with determined resistance,”
seized a position astride the Beisan-Jericho
road. Other troops on their left also made good
progress and by the 11th “a line had been captured
with great natural facilities for defence.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 11 and 12 deal with a raid on Amman.
The troops employed were the 60th Division, the
Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division,
the Imperial Camel Brigade, etc., the whole under
the General Officer Commanding 60th Division.
Heavy rains made the crossing of the Jordan a task
of almost insuperable difficulty and also made
progress very slow when the eastern bank was
reached. On 24th March the 60th Division drove
the enemy from a position which blocked the road
to Es Salt, captured three guns and pursued him for
four miles. On the 25th they occupied Es Salt.
The mounted troops effected the destruction of
portions of the railway. There was heavy fighting
on the 29th and 30th March, the Turks having been
reinforced; thereafter the Commander-in-Chief
ordered a withdrawal and this was carried out by
the evening of 2nd April. Troops were left on the
east side of the Jordan to form a bridgehead. Over
900 prisoners were taken in this raid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>On 30th April operations east of the Jordan
were again undertaken. “The 60th Division captured
the advanced works of the Shunet Nimrin
position but were unable to make further progress
in face of the stubborn resistance offered by the
enemy.” On 2nd May there was another attack but
the Turks were found to be in great strength. “The
60th Division was unable to make any substantial
progress, in spite of determined efforts.” About
1000 prisoners were taken in this operation. On 4th
May the force was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Paragraph 15 of the despatch refers to the reorganisation
of the Palestine Army consequent on
the departure of the 52nd and 74th Divisions for
France, and it states that 24 British battalions were
also withdrawn from the remaining divisions and
sent to France. The 60th contributed its share of
these, while the remainder of the Division continued
to set a very high standard of efficient work in the
field to the troops brought to Palestine from
Mesopotamia and India, to take the place of those
who had left for the western front. The 2/20th joined
the famous 62nd Division in August 1918.</p>

<p>In the despatch of 31st October, 1918, as to the
final overthrow of the Turks in Palestine, paragraph
9 shows that the break-through by the infantry
was entrusted to Sir E. Bulfin’s XXI. Corps, to
which the 60th Division was attached, it having
been moved from the right to the left of the line.
At 4.30 a.m. on 19th September, the XXI. Corps
attacked and, within 36 hours, “the greater part of
the VIII. Turkish Army had been overwhelmed.”</p>

<p>The 60th Division attacked in the coastal sector,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
then moved inland to leave “the coast route clear
for the Desert Mounted Corps.”</p>

<p>After the 20th the infantry had heavy marching
but no severe fighting. The operations 19th-25th
September are now “The Battles of Megiddo.”</p>

<p>The armistice with Turkey came into force on
31st October, but fighting had ceased on the 26th.
The 60th Division had certainly done a great deal
to bring about the satisfactory conclusion of the
War with Turkey.</p>

<p>Battalions of the Division were selected for the
Armies of Occupation as follows: for Western
Front, the 2/14th, 2/15th, 2/16th, 2/17th and
2/23rd London Regiment; for Egypt, 2/13th,
2/19th and 2/22nd London Regiment.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Division went to France in May 1916. On
19th-20th July they and an Australian division
made an attack in the Neuve Chapelle district.
Ground was gained but could not be held as the
guns on the Aubers Ridge had command of it.</p>

<p>The despatch from Sir Douglas Haig, dated 31st
May, 1917, paragraph 13, Messrs. Dent’s edition,
shows that the 61st was one of the divisions employed
in pursuing and pressing the enemy when he
retreated from the neighbourhood of the Somme
battlefield in March 1917. On 17th March the 61st
and 2nd Australian Divisions captured Chaulnes and
Bapaume.</p>

<p>The Division was for a time in the Third Battle
of Ypres and, as part of the XIX. Corps, attacked
on 22nd and 27th August and 5th September,
1917.</p>

<p>The Cambrai despatch of 20th February, 1918,
paragraph 9 (Dent’s edition) and map opposite
p. 163, shows that the 61st was in reserve on 30th
November, 1917, when the enemy made his great
counter-attack. On the night of the 1st December
they took over from the 12th in the neighbourhood
of La Vacquerie and for some days thereafter had
to fight hard to stem the German flood; in this they
were successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>The Division saw a great deal of heavy fighting
in 1918 and was frequently mentioned in despatches.
It formed part of the XVIII. Corps, Fifth Army,
in March of that year and was engaged throughout
the whole of the British retreat. At the end of ten
days’ continuous fighting the strength of the Division
was down to about 2000. They came out of
the battle with a splendid reputation, which was to
be enhanced later, on the Lys.</p>

<p>In the telegraphic despatch of 26th March, 1918,
Sir Douglas Haig said: “In the past six days of
constant fighting our troops on all parts of the
battle-front have shown the utmost courage,” and
among divisions which had exhibited “exceptional
gallantry” he mentioned the 61st.</p>

<p>In the written despatch of 20th July, 1918, paragraph
15, which deals with the 21st March, it is
stated: “Assisted by the long spell of dry weather
hostile infantry had crossed the river and canal north
of La Fère, and, south of St. Quentin, had penetrated
into the battle-zone between Essigny and Benay.
At Maissemy, also, our battle positions were entered
at about noon, but the vigorous resistance of the
61st and 24th Divisions, assisted by troops of the
1st Cavalry Division, prevented the enemy from
developing his success.”</p>

<p>The Division held its battle position intact against
the assaults of three German divisions, and only
retired in the afternoon of the 22nd when ordered
to do so in consequence of the enemy’s progress at
other parts of the line.</p>

<p>In his <cite>History of the British Campaign in France
and Flanders</cite>, vol. v., Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
a full account of the very arduous work of the
XVIII. Corps in the March retreat, and frequently
refers to the conduct of the 61st Division in terms
of very high praise. He gives a detailed description
of the most heroic resistance of the battalions in
the front line on the morning of 21st March and, as
an example of what was done, he tells the story of
the 2/4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light
Infantry which, under Colonel Wetherall, held out in
the Enghien Redoubt until it was finally submerged
by the ever increasing waves from the three German
divisions which attacked the front of the 61st. This
took place about 4.30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. Sparrow in his <cite>The Fifth Army in March
1918</cite>, also gives many particulars of the splendid
defence put up by the forward battalions of the
61st, on the 21st, as well as of the endless encounters
they had during the retreat. On p. 239
he mentions that parts of the Division were first
attacked at 5 a.m. on the 21st, and were only two
miles back at 3 a.m. on the 23rd, although for
48 hours the 61st was attacked by three German
divisions. On p. 102 he refers to it as “this brave
Division” and says that a Special Order of the day,
dated 18th April, stated that between 21st March
and that date the 61st had been opposed by 14
German divisions.</p>

<p>At p. 287 Mr. Sparrow remarks that the 61st had
been continuously in the line since 27th August,
1917, except when moving from one part to
another, and “then fought for twelve continuous
days.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 24 of the despatch states that on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
morning of the 23rd the Commander of the Fifth
Army ordered “a gradual withdrawal to the line
of the Somme.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 26: A gap occurred in our line near
Ham and bodies of Germans succeeded in crossing
the river. “In the afternoon these forces increased
in strength, gradually pressing back our troops, until
a spirited counter-attack by troops of the 20th and
61st Divisions about Verlaines restored the situation
in this locality.”</p>

<p>The fighting between 21st-23rd March is now
designated the “Battle of St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 31, “The Fight for the Somme Crossings”:
On the 24th various bodies of the enemy
had been able to effect crossings at different points.
“During the remainder of the day the enemy repeated
his attacks at these and other points, and also
exercised strong pressure in a westerly and south-westerly
direction from Ham. Our troops offered a
vigorous resistance and opposite Ham a successful
counter-attack by the 1/5th (Pioneer) Battalion,
Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry, 61st Division,
materially delayed his advance.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 44: On 28th March the British were
almost back to the Amiens defences and the enemy
were seriously pressing the French on our right. “A
gallant attempt by troops of the 61st Division to
regain Warfusée-Abancourt and lighten the pressure
from the north proved unsuccessful.... At nightfall
we held approximately the Amiens defence line
on the whole front south of the Somme.”</p>

<p>Fortunately that same day the enemy had been
defeated north of the Somme (see 56th, 42nd and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
62nd Divisions), and in a few days his offensive on
the front south of Arras ceased.</p>

<p>In his account of the 28th, Mr. Sparrow deals
with the work of “the intrepid 61st,” and remarks
“one and all behaved with the greatest gallantry.”</p>

<p>In Colonel à Court Repington’s Memoirs, <cite>The
First World War</cite>, Constable, vol. ii., p. 269, there
is detailed a conversation, on 7th April, 1918,
with General Gough, the Commander of the Fifth
Army. After some particulars of the great struggle
there occurs the sentence, “He brought with him
some of Maxse’s notes, which mentioned particularly
the fine conduct of the 61st Division, under Colin
Mackenzie.” Lieut.-General Maxse commanded the
XVIII. Corps.</p>

<p>The despatch of 20th July, 1918, deals also with
the Lys battle which began on 9th April, 1918
(see 55th, 49th, 50th and 51st Divisions). Paragraph
58 shows that several divisions were brought straight
from the Somme fighting to the Lys area. Among
these was the 61st. Dealing with the 12th April,
the despatch states: “On the left of the 51st the
61st Division was coming into action about the
Clarence river. Both the 3rd and 61st Divisions had
been engaged in many days of continuous fighting
south of Arras; but with the arrival of these troops,
battle-weary though they were, the enemy’s progress
in this sector was definitely checked.”</p>

<p>The fighting 12th-15th April is now the “Battle
of Hazebrouck.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 65 deals with the great effort made
by the enemy on 18th April on the southern front
of his salient. “At certain points there was severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
and continuous fighting.... Elsewhere the enemy
failed to obtain even an initial success, being repulsed,
with exceedingly heavy loss, at all points,
by the 4th and 61st Divisions.” And, referring to
a few days later: “Further west the 4th Division,
in co-operation with the 61st Division, carried out
a series of successful local operations, north of the
La Bassée canal, resulting in the capture of some
hundreds of prisoners, and a considerable improvement
of our positions between the Lawe and
Clarence rivers.” The action on 18th April is now
the “Battle of Béthune.”</p>

<p>The Division joined the XVII. Corps early in
October 1918, and with it took part in the “Advance
to Victory.”</p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, as to the
final British offensive, paragraph 47, Battle of the
Selle River, 17th-25th October, shows that the 61st
Division, as part of the XVII. Corps of the Third
Army, attacked on 24th October. “About many
of the woods and villages which lay in the way of
our attack there was severe fighting, particularly
in the large wood known as the Bois L’Évêque, and
at Pommereuil, Bousies Forest and Vendegies-sur-Écaillon.
This latter village held out till the afternoon
of the 24th October when it was taken by an
enveloping attack by troops of the 19th Division
and 61st Division.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 49, “The Battle of the Sambre,”
1st-11th November: As a preliminary to the main
attack it is stated that on 1st November “the XVII.
Corps of the Third Army and the XXII. and
Canadian Corps of the First Army attacked on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
front of about six miles south of Valenciennes and
in the course of two days of heavy fighting inflicted
a severe defeat on the enemy. During these two days
the 61st, Major-General F. J. Duncan, 49th and
4th Divisions crossed the Rhonelle river, capturing
Maresches and Preseau after a stubborn struggle,
and established themselves on the high ground
two miles to the east of it. On their left the
4th Canadian Division captured Valenciennes and
made progress beyond the town.”</p>

<p>The fighting on 1st-2nd November is now designated
the “Battle of Valenciennes.”</p>

<p>On the 3rd November the enemy withdrew, and
the British line was advanced.</p>

<p>The XVII. Corps was again employed on the left
of the Third Army in the Battle of the Sambre on
the 4th November when “the enemy’s resistance
was definitely broken.”</p>

<p>Battalions from the Division were selected for the
Armies of Occupation, as follows: Western Front,
2/6th and 2/7th Royal Warwickshire Regiment,
2/5th Gloucestershire Regiment and 1/5th Duke
of Cornwall’s Light Infantry (Pioneers). For Egypt,
2/8th Worcestershire Regiment, 2/4th Oxfordshire
and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and 2/4th
Royal Berkshire Regiment.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The 62nd Division, under the command of Major-General
W. P. Braithwaite, who had gained distinction
as chief of Sir Ian Hamilton’s staff in
Gallipoli, left England for France on 11th January,
1917, and, on arrival, was taken to the Albert-Arras
area. On 13th February they entered the line
about Serre, thereafter until the end of March they
were one of the divisions employed in pressing the
enemy, and in causing him to hasten his withdrawal
from the old Somme front. The pursuit came to a
standstill near Bullecourt on the Hindenburg line.
The capture of that place was to involve much hard
fighting. The Division at this time was in the V.
Corps, Fifth Army.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 25th December,
1917, as to the campaigns of that year, paragraph
16 (Dent’s edition), describes the fighting on 11th
April in the Battle of Arras. “In combination with
this attack on the Third Army front, the Fifth Army
launched an attack at 4.30 a.m. on the 11th April
against the Hindenburg Line in the neighbourhood
of Bullecourt (4th Australian Division and 62nd
Division, Major-Generals W. Holmes and W. P.
Braithwaite). The Australian and West Riding
battalions engaged showed great gallantry in
executing a very difficult attack across a wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
extent of open country. Considerable progress was
made and parties of Australian troops, preceded by
tanks, penetrated the German positions as far as
Riencourt-lez-Cagnicourt.” As the Third Army
was held up on this day the Fifth Army had to
withdraw. Progress was made on the 12th.</p>

<p>Paragraph 27: “To secure the footing gained
by the Australians in the Hindenburg Line on
3rd May it was advisable that Bullecourt should
be captured without loss of time.... On the
morning of the 7th May English troops (7th Division)
gained a footing in the south-east corner of
Bullecourt. Thereafter gradual progress was made
in the face of the most obstinate resistance and on
the 17th May London and West Riding Territorials
(58th and 62nd Divisions) completed the capture
of the village.” The operations 3rd to 17th May
are now the “Battle of Bullecourt.”</p>

<p>Throughout the summer of 1917 the 62nd remained
in the district south of Arras, but had no
heavy fighting until the “Battle of Cambrai, 1917.”</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s despatch of 20th February,
1918, as to the “Battle of Cambrai, 1917,” 20th
November to 3rd December, paragraph 3, dealing
with the attack on 20th November, said: “The
62nd (West Riding) Division, T., stormed Havrincourt
where also parties of the enemy held
out for a time.... West of Flesquières the 62nd
Division operating northwards from Havrincourt
made important progress. Having carried the
Hindenburg reserve line north of that village it
rapidly continued its attack and captured Graincourt,
where two anti-tank guns were destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
by the tanks accompanying our infantry. Before
nightfall infantry and cavalry had entered Anneux
although the enemy’s resistance in this village does
not appear to have been finally overcome until the
following morning. This attack of the 62nd (West
Riding) Division constitutes a brilliant achievement
in which the troops concerned completed an advance
of four and a half miles from their original front,
overrunning two German systems of defence and
gaining possession of three villages.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 4, 21st November, stated: “Following
upon the capture of Flesquières the 51st and 62nd
Divisions, in co-operation with a number of tanks
and squadrons of the 1st Cavalry Division, attacked
at 10.30 a.m. in the direction of Fontaine-Notre-Dame
and Bourlon.” After drawing attention to the
strain on the troops engaged in these operations
Sir Douglas Haig said, paragraph 7: “It was
decided to make another effort on 27th November
to capture Fontaine-Notre-Dame and Bourlon
village,” etc. “In this attack in which tanks co-operated,
British Guards temporarily regained
possession of Fontaine, taking some hundreds of
prisoners, and troops of the 62nd Division once
more entered Bourlon village. Later in the morning,
however, heavy counter-attacks developed in both
localities and our troops were unable to maintain
the ground they had gained.” The Division was
relieved by the 47th on the night of the 28th-29th.
It was in reserve on the 30th November when the
enemy counter-attacked in great force—see paragraph
9 of despatch, also under 47th, 55th, and
56th Divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>In the beginning of 1918, the Division was about
Arras, on 5th January it took over from the 56th
between Gavrelle and Oppy.</p>

<p>Soon after the launching of the German attack
from the St. Quentin district, on 21st March, reinforcements
were sent to the southern portions of
the British front. On 25th March the 62nd Division
arrived at Bucquoy and joined the IV. Corps of the
Third Army. Along with the 42nd Division they
formed a new line through which the worn-out 19th,
25th, 41st and 51st Divisions withdrew. The 62nd,
which entered the front line on the 25th, had very
heavy fighting on the 26th, 27th and 28th. On the
afternoon of the 26th alone five attacks by regiments
of the Prussian Guard were repulsed. After a
magnificent stand the Division was relieved by the
37th on 31st March and 1st April. The fighting on
24th-25th is now the “First Battle of Bapaume,”
and that on the 28th the “First Battle of Arras,
1918.”</p>

<p>Under the 42nd Division a quotation has already
been given from the telegraphic despatch of 23rd
April, 1918, in which the part played by the 42nd
and 62nd about Bucquoy is referred to.</p>

<p>The written despatch of 20th July, 1918, paragraph
42, mentions that on 27th March the enemy
made a series of strong attacks when he gained
Ablainzevelle and Ayette. “Elsewhere all his
assaults were heavily repulsed by troops of the 62nd
Division (Major-General W. P. Braithwaite) and of
the 42nd and the Guards Divisions.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 45 as to the attack near Arras, 28th
March, states: “The 62nd Division with an attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
brigade of the 4th Australian Division beat off a
succession of heavy attacks about Bucquoy with
great loss to the enemy.”</p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
11, shows that in July the XXII. Corps, Lieut.-General
Sir A. Godley, consisting of the 15th, 34th,
51st and 62nd Divisions, was sent to the south to
assist the French in their counter-attacks against
the salient which the Germans had created between
the Aisne and the Marne. The 51st and 62nd went
to the east side of the salient and had heavy fighting
for a period of ten days—a quotation as to this,
now the “Battle of Tardenois,” is given under the
51st. Both these divisions were complimented by
General Berthelot commanding the French Fifth
Army. The 8th West Yorkshire Regiment (Leeds
Rifles) of the 62nd were awarded the coveted
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Croix de Guerre</i> with palms, for a brilliant assault
on Mont de Bligny on 28th July.</p>

<p>In the supplementary telegraphic despatch of
13th September, 1918, as to the work of certain
divisions, Sir Douglas Haig said: “The 62nd Division
assisted to check the enemy’s advance in March
at Achiet-le-Grand and Bucquoy and since that
date took part with credit in the French offensive
south-west of Reims. On August 25th it attacked
and captured Mory. The Division was involved in
heavy fighting about this village and around Vaulx-Vraucourt
and Vaulx Wood and beat off several
determined counter-attacks with great loss to the
enemy.” The capture of Mory is again referred to
in the despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
23. Between the 25th August and 2nd September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
the Division had some very stern fighting and
suffered heavy losses before its opponents were
overcome. The fighting 31st August-3rd September
is now the “Second Battle of Bapaume.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 30 of the despatch, “The Battle of
Havrincourt and Epéhy 12th-18th September,”
stated: “On the 12th September the IV. and VI.
Corps of the Third Army attacked on a front of
about five miles in the Havrincourt sector, employing
troops of the New Zealand, 37th, 62nd and 2nd
Divisions. The villages of Trescault and Havrincourt
were taken by the 37th and 62nd Divisions
respectively, and positions were secured which were
of considerable importance in view of future
operations.” This is now designated the “Battle
of Havrincourt.” It will be remembered that the
Division stormed Havrincourt in the battle of 20th
November, 1917. It was on familiar ground.</p>

<p>In “The Battle of Cambrai and the Hindenburg
Line, 27th September-5th October,” the VI.
Corps was again employed, the 62nd being in support
of the 3rd Division. (See paragraph 35 of the
despatch and map opposite p. 280 of Messrs. Dent’s
edition.) On 27th and 28th September the 62nd
captured Marcoing and Masnières and established a
bridgehead on the St. Quentin canal. On the 29th
they made a further advance. The Official List
has altered the designation given in the despatch.
This is now the “Battle of the Canal du Nord,
27th September-1st October.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 46. “The Battle of the Selle River,
17th-25th October,” shows that the 62nd was one
of the divisions employed on the 20th. The fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
was severe but all objectives were gained on
the high ground east of the river. A quotation as
to this action has been given under the 42nd Division.
Unofficial accounts agree that both the 42nd
and 62nd did particularly well on the 20th October
about Solesmes.</p>

<p>Paragraph 50, “The Battle of the Sambre, 1st-11th
November,” dealing with the 4th November,
stated: “Opposite Orsinval the 62nd Division of
the VI. Corps attacked at 5.20 a.m., and as soon as
that village had been taken the Guards Division of
the same corps attacked on the left of them. Both
Divisions had hard fighting but made good progress
capturing Frasnoy and Preux-au-Sart, and reaching
the western outskirts of Commegnies.”</p>

<p>Paragraph 51, “The Return to Mons”: “The
enemy’s resistance was definitely broken. On the
9th November the enemy was in general retreat on
the whole front of the British Armies. The fortress
of Maubeuge was entered by the Guards Division
and the 62nd Division (Major-General Sir R. D.
Whigham), while the Canadians were approaching
Mons,” which they entered on the 11th, Armistice
Day.</p>

<p>The final despatch of 21st March, 1919 (the anniversary
of the great German offensive), paragraph
5, gives the composition of the troops selected to
form General Plumer’s Second Army, for the march
into the British sector in the Rhine provinces; to
the 62nd Division was awarded the signal honour
of representing the Territorial Force. The Commander-in-Chief
may have been influenced by many
reasons in making this choice, but unless its marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
had been “very good” the 62nd would not have
been selected.</p>

<p>The 2/4th West Riding Regiment and 2/4th
Yorkshire Light Infantry were chosen for the Army
of Occupation, as was also the 1/9th Durham Light
Infantry, originally belonging to the 50th, but which
served as pioneers to the 62nd in 1918.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Division landed in France in the last week of
February 1917, and was employed for some months
with the First and Second Armies about the Bethune-Ypres-Nieuport
area.</p>

<p>In the last week of September 1917 the 66th was
relieved in the Coast Sector by the 42nd, the senior
East Lancashire Division. The 66th then moved
into the battle area and joined the Fifth Army,
east of Ypres. It came suddenly into prominence
in October, when the closing stages of the Third
Battle of Ypres were being fought.</p>

<p>In his telegraphic despatch of 9th October, Sir
Douglas Haig said: “On the right centre a third-line
Territorial Division, comprising Manchester,
East Lancashire and Lancashire Fusilier Regiments,
advanced one mile northwards along the ridge
in the direction of Passchendaele, capturing all
its objectives under the most trying and difficult
circumstances with great determination and
gallantry.”</p>

<p>It was not a “third-line” division in the ordinary
acceptance of the words, but it did contain a third-line
battalion, the 3/5th Lancashire Fusiliers, who
were said to have done exceptionally well.</p>

<p>A quotation from paragraph 56 of the written
despatch of 25th December, 1917, as to this attack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
now designated the “Battle of Poelcappelle,” has
been given under the 48th Division.</p>

<p>During the German offensive and British retreat
of March 1918 the 66th formed part of the XIX.
Corps, Fifth Army, the other division of the Corps
in the line on 21st March being the 24th.</p>

<p>On the 21st the XIX. Corps was attacked by the
enemy in overwhelming force. Both divisions fought
splendidly and although their forward posts were
surrounded and eventually destroyed, the battle
zone of the Corps was held throughout the day.
The enemy made progress, however, round the left
or north flank of the 66th, and the right or south
flank of the 24th Division, which compelled a
withdrawal.</p>

<p>In the telegraphic despatch of 26th March, 1918,
Sir Douglas Haig said: “In the past six days of
constant fighting our troops on all parts of the battle
front have shown the utmost courage,” and among
divisions which had shown “exceptional gallantry”
he mentioned the 66th.</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig’s written despatch of 20th July,
1918, regarding the great German offensive, paragraph
20, the position of affairs on the 22nd March,
stated: “At midday, after heavy fighting in the
neighbourhood of Roisel, the 66th Division, under
the command of Major-General N. Malcolm, D.S.O.,
still held their positions in this sector, having, for
the time being, definitely stopped the enemy’s
advance. To the south and north, however, the
progress of the German infantry continued, ...
Roisel being threatened from the rear. Accordingly
our troops about Roisel were withdrawn during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
afternoon under orders, the enemy making no
attempt to interfere.” The fighting 21st-23rd March,
1918, is now the “Battle of St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>In paragraph 43, regarding the fight for the
Rosières line on 27th March, now the “Battle of
Rosières,” it was said by Sir Douglas Haig that
“the situation south of the Somme was serious.”
“A counter-attack by the 66th Division restored
the situation about Framerville.”</p>

<p>In paragraph 47 as to the fighting in the Avre
and Luce valleys, on 29th and 30th March, Sir
Douglas Haig said, “North of the Luce also the
enemy made some progress but in the afternoon
was held up, and finally driven back into Aubercourt
by counter-attacks carried out by troops of
the 66th Division and the 3rd Australian Division.”</p>

<p>In his “Fifth Army in March, 1918,” Mr. Sparrow
constantly refers to the splendid conduct of the 66th.
At p. 101 he mentions that they fought continuously
from the 21st to the 31st and that their losses were
nearly 7000 “apart from sick and spent.” At p. 134
he says that their strength on the evening of the
30th was 104 officers and 2376 other ranks, excluding
transport. “Thus to the last the 66th was in the
fire,” and speaking of the counter-attack which they
made on the 30th he said, “seldom have exhausted
men made an equal effort.”</p>

<p>Their losses were so severe that the Division was
reduced to a cadre basis, see note, paragraph 1,
despatch of 21st December, 1918 (Messrs. Dent’s
edition); but it was filled up in time to take part in
the “Advance to Victory.”</p>

<p>The South African Brigade, which had gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
very great distinction on many occasions, as part
of the 9th Division, was incorporated in the reconstituted
66th, and it was also joined by the following
battalions from the Mediterranean: the 6th Lancashire
Fusiliers, 5th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, and
6th Royal Dublin Fusiliers, forming the 198th
Brigade; the 18th Liverpool Regiment (formerly
Lancashire Yeomanry), 9th Manchester Regiment
and 5th Connaught Rangers, forming the 199th
Brigade, with, as pioneers, the 9th Gloucestershire
Regiment. (See <cite>The Story of the Fourth Army</cite>,
p. 322.)</p>

<p>The despatch of 21st December, 1918, paragraph
42, “Second Battle of Le Cateau, 8th to 12th
October,” now officially designated the “Battle of
Cambrai, 1918, with pursuit to the Selle,” shows
that the Division formed part of the troops
attacking on 8th October, being then in the XIII.
Corps, Fourth Army, when “on the British front
infantry and tanks penetrated the enemy’s position
to a depth of between three and four miles, passing
rapidly over the incomplete trench lines.”</p>

<p>To the north of the 30th American Division which
had “captured Brancourt and Prémont the 66th
Division (Major-General H. K. Bethell), attacking
beside the 25th Division (Major-General J. R. E.
Charles), captured Serain.” The advance was continued
on the 9th; “by nightfall our troops were
within two miles of Le Cateau.” A further forward
movement was made on the 10th and in <cite>The History
of the 25th Division</cite>, p. 329, it is stated that by the
evening of the 10th “the 66th Division, which had
got well forward on the left, had a few advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
patrols in Le Cateau itself.” This is correct, but
there was to be very heavy fighting before the town
was captured. The Selle runs through the town,
and the portion on the eastern side of the river was
not taken till the 17th.</p>

<p>Paragraph 46, “The forcing of the Selle River
crossings, 17th-25th October,” now the “Battle
of the Selle,” mentions the 66th as again employed
by the XIII. Corps. “The enemy was holding the
difficult wooded country east of Bohain and the
line of the Selle north of it, in great strength, his
infantry being well supported by artillery....
By the evening of the 19th October, after much
severe fighting, the enemy had been driven across the
Sambre and Oise canal at practically all points south
of Catillon, whence our line followed the valley of
the Richemont east and north of Le Cateau.” That
town was taken by the 66th Division.</p>

<p>On the night of the 16th the 9th Gloucestershire,
Pioneers to the Division, and the Divisional Engineers
threw eight bridges across the Selle, here
twenty feet wide and five feet deep, and the South
African Brigade crossed to the east bank. Later
they forced their way through the wire entanglements
and carried their objectives. In the <cite>Story of
the Fourth Army</cite>, p. 224, there occurs this sentence:
“The position attacked by the 66th Division, and
especially by the South African Brigade, requires
to be studied on the ground before the difficulties
overcome by the initiative and leadership of the
regimental officers and non-commissioned officers,
and by the gallantry of all ranks, can be fully
realised. None but the very best troops could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
attempted, let alone have succeeded in, such an
enterprise, and the crossing of the Selle at Le Cateau
will always remain, like the struggle in Delville
Wood in 1916, a lasting testimony to the fighting
qualities of the South African soldier.” A captured
German order contained the sentence: “The English
must not cross the Selle on our front.”</p>

<p>Sir A. Conan Doyle, vol. vi. pp. 187-190, gives
a detailed and excellent account of the attack on
17th October. He says: “It had been a very desperate
battle, the laurels of which rest with the
South African Brigade, who had carried out so
remarkable an assault, and also with the 50th
Division which had held on with such a bull-dog
grip to its purpose.”</p>

<p>The XIII. Corps was engaged in “The Battle of
the Sambre,” commencing on 4th November, the
66th being in support of the 25th, which captured
Landrecies. (See under 48th Division, three battalions
of which did great work.) See also paragraph
50 of the despatch and map opposite p. 294 of
Messrs. Dent’s edition.</p>

<p>On 7th November the 66th relieved the 25th and
continued the advance beyond Avesnes, being
practically advance-guard to the Fourth Army.
At the date of the Armistice the Division held the
front from Sivry to a point west of Beaumont.</p>

<p>The work of the 66th Division between 8th
October and 11th November is fully described in
<cite>The Story of the Fourth Army</cite> already referred to.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><span class="smcap">Showing the Battles, as named in the Official List
published in 1921, in which the Territorial
Divisions took part.</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">Since the foregoing notes were put together there has
been published “The Official Names of the Battles and
other Engagements fought by the Military Forces of the
British Empire during the Great War, 1914-1919, and
Third Afghan War, 1919, being the Report of the Battles
Nomenclature Committee, as approved by the Army
Council.”</p>

<p>A list of the battles in which a division has been present
affords some idea of its services to the Empire, but
opportunities varied according to the theatre, and while
the work of those troops which went early to the East
was of inestimable importance and while very many of
their battalions fought in Mesopotamia, Palestine and
elsewhere, they had no chance of employment as divisions
in the field, hence, through no fault of their own, their
honours as divisions are <em>nil</em>. In the case of some which
operated in France the urgency of affairs, in the early
years of the War, was such as to necessitate their employment
as reinforcements in single battalions to Regular
brigades, and it must not be forgotten that the component
parts of some divisions, such as the 55th and 56th, were
nearly a year, more in the case of some battalions, in
France before they were concentrated as divisions. In
their case again a mere list of battle honours in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
formation is inadequate as a token of their value. Some of
those so placed seem to have made up lost time splendidly.</p>

<p>It would be presumption to say that the following table
is complete. There will be many claims which will require
very careful scrutiny, and only the Authorities, with all
the material of the Historical Section of the War Office at
their disposal, will be competent to adjudicate upon them.
On the other hand the despatches do mention certain
units, and other works of a semi-official character, already
published, supplement the reports of the various Commanders;
from such sources a fairly complete list can be
made up.</p>

<p>In this Appendix, where a division has been mentioned
in despatches or works such as the “Story of the Fourth
Army,” as taking part in a battle, or is shown in the maps
appended to these, the Battle is in ordinary type; but
where the information is derived from sources not so
strictly official, the name of the Battle is printed in italics.
In compiling this appendix it has been thought better not
to ask information from units as to their own doings.</p>

<p>The geographical or boundary limits give trouble as
regards divisions in support. Sometimes these seem to
have been partly within and partly outside the limits.
Where there is a probable claim this has been noted.</p>

<p>The chronological or time limits give no licence, and it
is perhaps a little hard on some units that did some very
severe fighting on one or more days before or after a
recognised battle that they should be excluded. Particularly
hard cases seem to be those of the 50th, 61st and
66th in connection with the fighting in the region of the
Avre and Luce valleys, 28th-30th March, 1918, when
these and other divisions by their splendid efforts prevented
the line from being broken, and that after they
had long passed all credible limits of endurance. The
Battle of Rosières is given the dates 26th and 27th March,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
and that of the Avre, 4th April, by which latter date these
three divisions were out of the line, the fighting 28th-30th
March, south of the Somme, is thus outside both battles,
although the despatch, in which these three divisions are
mentioned, seems to give it an importance equal to that
of the fighting on 4th April.</p>

<p>Again the Battle of the Somme, 1916, the Third Battle
of Ypres, now the Battles of Ypres, 1917, and the First
and Second Battles of the Somme, 1918, have each been
sub-divided into a number of battles with fixed time
limits; but in the course of these epic struggles certain
divisions had intense fighting, with most serious losses,
on days which are not within the dates of any of the
recognised battles. For example, the 55th at the Somme,
1916, the 42nd and 47th at Ypres, 1917, and the 62nd at
the Second Somme, 1918, all made big and costly endeavours
on days outside the chronological boundaries of a recognised
battle. No doubt they will get the general honour,
such as “The Battles of Ypres, 1917,” and have to be
content with that.</p>

<p>The Committee have clearly taken great pains to arrive
at sound principles, and to apply these wisely, and as they
had every possible advantage in the way of information,
their decisions, although in odd cases causing disappointment,
will doubtless be accepted in the true soldiers’ spirit.</p>

<p>In 1918 several Territorial divisions were practically
destroyed, such as the 50th and 66th; these were during
the last few months reconstituted, being made up largely
with Regular or New Army battalions. Such divisions
have been treated as Territorial to the end. If this is
considered more than fair to the Territorial Force it is
counterbalanced by the fact that some of the New Army
Divisions, which had also been very hardly hit, such as
the 34th, were, after the spring campaign of 1918, composed
largely of Territorial battalions from Italy and Palestine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
The 25th has most handsomely admitted their good
fortune in receiving seasoned battalions from Italy, including
a brigade of the 48th.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
